Abstract
Social media are implicated in many of contemporary society's most pressing issues, from influencing public opinion, to organizing social movements, and identifying economic trends. Increasing the capacity of researchers to understand the dynamics of such social, behavioral and economic phenomena will depend on reliable, curated, discoverable and accessible social media data. To that end, ICPSR will develop a new archive of curated datasets, workflows, and code for use by social science researchers for the empirical analysis of social media platforms, content, and user behavior. The goal is to provide a user-friendly, large-scale, next-generation data resource for researchers conducting data-intensive research using data from social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Instagram. In our presentation, we will explain SOMAR's goals and structure and discuss opportunities for collaboration.

Project Description
Summary
View help for Summary
This data collection contains the basic information about
all counties in the coterminous United States needed for mapping
county-based data. It provides an interface between ICPSR datasets and
the mapping programs SAS/GRAPH, SURFACE II, and SYMAP. Cloropleth and
isopleth maps can be produced by match-merging this dataset with any
other dataset (special facilities exist for ICPSR datasets) and
running the merged data against a cartographic program. Isopleth
mapping programs, using the latitude and longitude coordinates provided
for each county seat, can produce maps of ICPSR data. Cloropleth
mapping of county-level data can be accomplished after merging by
running the merged dataset through SAS/GRAPH. The variables
provide state Federal Information Processing (FIPS) codes, county FIPS
codes, county names/county seat names, the month, day, and year in which each county was created, the latitude and longitude of county seats, as well as the ICPSR state and county codes.

Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)
Description
The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) was founded over 50 years ago ""to
further the development of research in political science"" (Miller 1963:11). Since that summer of 1962, the scope
and range of services ICPSR offers has expanded significantly to encompass the wider social and behavioral
research community, and from a handful of data collections to thousands. With over 750 consortial members
from around the world, ICPSR is now a leader in preserving, curating, and providing access to scientific data so
others can reuse the data and validate research findings. Much of the success of ICPSR can be traced back to the
consortial model upon which the organization was founded, with members providing funding, input, and a sense
of community. This article describes the history and current status of the consortium, and discusses upcoming
challenges and opportunities.

Summary
View help for Summary
The Survey of Program Dynamics (SPD) Third Longitudinal
File is a fully edited file that provides socioeconomic data for the
calendar years 1992-2001, except 1995. It is intended for longitudinal
analyses of effects of welfare reform on individuals, families, and
households. The file can be linked to the Survey of Program Dynamics
(SPD) First Longitudinal File (ICPSR 3315), SPD Second Longitudinal
File (ICPSR 3594), SPD 1997 Bridge (ICPSR 2797), SPD 1998 (ICPSR
2917), and the SIPP panel files for 1992 (ICPSR 6429) and 1993 (ICPSR
6886). The subject matter is described as follows: demographic data
(age, sex, ethnic origin, marital status, household relationship,
education, and veteran status), economic data (work experience,
employment status, occupation, industry, weeks worked and hours per
week worked, total income, and income components for people 15 years
and older), income data (income from jobs, net income from business,
farm or rent, pensions, dividends, interest, and Social Security
payments), and data covering noncash income sources (food stamps,
school lunch program, employer-provided group health insurance plan,
employer-provided pension plans, Medicaid, Medicare, CHAMPUS or
military health care, and energy assistance). The file contains codes
for 41 individual states, plus the District of Columbia. The SPD
sample in the nine remaining states is identified in three groups for
confidentiality reasons: (1) Maine and Vermont, (2) Iowa, North
Dakota, and South Dakota, and (3) Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and
Wyoming. The sample is not designed to produce state estimates.

A note of caution about this file. The weights on this
file are longitudinal, therefore, they are only valid for estimates of
the characteristics of the cohorts of people who were represented by
the original sample persons from the SIPP 1992 and 1993 panels. An
original sample person is a sample person who was a self or proxy
respondent in Wave 1 of the SIPP 1992 or 1993 panel. Children born
since the beginning of the SIPP panel to original sample persons also
receive longitudinal weights. The original sample has undergone a
substantial amount of attrition from 1992 (or 1993) through 2002. As a
result, estimates from this file are not as representative of the
United States population as a cross-sectional survey would be.
Therefore, results should be viewed with caution. In addition, it
should be noted that this file is based on seven different survey
collection vehicles: the 1992/93 SIPP instruments that were used to
produce data for 1992, 1993, and 1994, a 1-7 modified March CPS
instrument that was used to collect data for calendar year 1996, the
1998 SPD instrument that was used to collect data for calendar year
1997, the 1999 SPD instrument that was used to collect data for
calendar year 1998, the 2000 SPD instrument that was used to collect
data for calendar year 1999, the 2001 SPD instrument that was used to
collect data for calendar year 2000 and the 2002 SPD instrument that
was used to collect data for calendar year 2001. Therefore, changes
that are noted over time could be the result of the different survey
instruments used to produce the estimates.

Methodology
Sample
View help for Sample
The SURVEY OF PROGRAM DYNAMICS (SPD), 1997: BRIDGE SURVEY
(ICPSR 2797) interviewed approximately 29,619 households from retired
1992 and 1993 Survey in Income and Program Participation (SIPP)
panels, which were scientifically selected on the basis of area of
residence to represent the nation as a whole. For the SPD 1998 (ICPSR
2917), from the households interviewed in 1997, a subsample of 19,129
households was selected for the continuing sample. Low-income
households and households with children were selected with certainty
or near certainty. Middle- and high-income households without children
had a 1-in-4 chance of being selected for the sample.
Universe
View help for Universe
The universe consists of people who resided in the United
States, except people living in institutions, such as prisons and
nursing homes or entire military households, in March 1992 and/or
March 1993. The universe is represented by original sample persons
from the 1992 and 1993 Survey of Income and Program Participation
(SIPP) panels, except those who were subsampled out because of cost
constraints or leaving the universe before the 1998 interview.

Description
The National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health  (NIH) have funded a large number of social science data collections over  the last several decades. ICPSR, as part of the Data Preservation  Alliance for the Social Sciences (Data-PASS) project, has undertaken a  systematic review of grant awards made by NSF and NIH with a major goal  of determining the extent to which important social science data have  been collected, but not preserved or archived. We have found that the  majority of data collections produced by NIH and NSF awards have not  been archived. Our preliminary results from this project suggest that  there are many reasons that data are not archived. The benefits of  developing and implementing a data archiving plan at early parts of the  data life cycle will also be discussed.

Project Description
Summary
View help for Summary
Data were collected in this follow-up survey to compare
estimates of the incidence of intrafamily physical violence with
estimates obtained in an earlier survey, PHYSICAL VIOLENCE IN AMERICAN
FAMILIES, 1976 (ICPSR 7733). The main component of this survey design
was a national cross-sectional survey of adults in the United States
who either (1) were currently married or living together, (2) were
single parents with children under 18 in the household, or (3) had been
married or had lived with a partner of the opposite sex within the past
two years. Approximately two-thirds of American households met one of
these three requirements at the time of the survey. Another objective
of the survey was to generate comparisons of the incidence of
intrafamily physical violence by race and ethnicity. Variables in this
data collection include number of couples, single parents, and children
in the household, respondent's race, ethnicity, sex, age, and marital
status, number of persons in the household previously married, years
lived in the community, and employment/occupation information.

Project Description
Summary
View help for Summary
The Survey of Program Dynamics (SPD) Third Longitudinal
File is a fully edited file that provides socioeconomic data for the
calendar years 1992-2001, except 1995. It is intended for longitudinal
analyses of effects of welfare reform on individuals, families, and
households. The file can be linked to the Survey of Program Dynamics
(SPD) First Longitudinal File (ICPSR 3315), SPD Second Longitudinal
File (ICPSR 3594), SPD 1997 Bridge (ICPSR 2797), SPD 1998 (ICPSR
2917), and the SIPP panel files for 1992 (ICPSR 6429) and 1993 (ICPSR
6886). The subject matter is described as follows: demographic data
(age, sex, ethnic origin, marital status, household relationship,
education, and veteran status), economic data (work experience,
employment status, occupation, industry, weeks worked and hours per
week worked, total income, and income components for people 15 years
and older), income data (income from jobs, net income from business,
farm or rent, pensions, dividends, interest, and Social Security
payments), and data covering noncash income sources (food stamps,
school lunch program, employer-provided group health insurance plan,
employer-provided pension plans, Medicaid, Medicare, CHAMPUS or
military health care, and energy assistance). The file contains codes
for 41 individual states, plus the District of Columbia. The SPD
sample in the nine remaining states is identified in three groups for
confidentiality reasons: (1) Maine and Vermont, (2) Iowa, North
Dakota, and South Dakota, and (3) Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and
Wyoming. The sample is not designed to produce state estimates.

A note of caution about this file. The weights on this
file are longitudinal, therefore, they are only valid for estimates of
the characteristics of the cohorts of people who were represented by
the original sample persons from the SIPP 1992 and 1993 panels. An
original sample person is a sample person who was a self or proxy
respondent in Wave 1 of the SIPP 1992 or 1993 panel. Children born
since the beginning of the SIPP panel to original sample persons also
receive longitudinal weights. The original sample has undergone a
substantial amount of attrition from 1992 (or 1993) through 2002. As a
result, estimates from this file are not as representative of the
United States population as a cross-sectional survey would be.
Therefore, results should be viewed with caution. In addition, it
should be noted that this file is based on seven different survey
collection vehicles: the 1992/93 SIPP instruments that were used to
produce data for 1992, 1993, and 1994, a 1-7 modified March CPS
instrument that was used to collect data for calendar year 1996, the
1998 SPD instrument that was used to collect data for calendar year
1997, the 1999 SPD instrument that was used to collect data for
calendar year 1998, the 2000 SPD instrument that was used to collect
data for calendar year 1999, the 2001 SPD instrument that was used to
collect data for calendar year 2000 and the 2002 SPD instrument that
was used to collect data for calendar year 2001. Therefore, changes
that are noted over time could be the result of the different survey
instruments used to produce the estimates.

The SURVEY OF PROGRAM DYNAMICS (SPD), 1997: BRIDGE SURVEY
(ICPSR 2797) interviewed approximately 29,619 households from retired
1992 and 1993 Survey in Income and Program Participation (SIPP)
panels, which were scientifically selected on the basis of area of
residence to represent the nation as a whole. For the SPD 1998 (ICPSR
2917), from the households interviewed in 1997, a subsample of 19,129
households was selected for the continuing sample. Low-income
households and households with children were selected with certainty
or near certainty. Middle- and high-income households without children
had a 1-in-4 chance of being selected for the sample.

The universe consists of people who resided in the United
States, except people living in institutions, such as prisons and
nursing homes or entire military households, in March 1992 and/or
March 1993. The universe is represented by original sample persons
from the 1992 and 1993 Survey of Income and Program Participation
(SIPP) panels, except those who were subsampled out because of cost
constraints or leaving the universe before the 1998 interview.

View help for Summary
To reduce respondent burden and improve data quality and timeliness, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) split the jail census into two parts: The Census of Jail Inmates was conducted with a reference date of June 30, 2005. The following spring it was followed by this enumeration, the Census of Jail Facilities, which collected data as of March 31, 2006. Previous jail enumerations were conducted in 1970 (ICPSR 7641), 1972 (ICPSR 7638), 1978 (ICPSR 7737), 1983 (ICPSR 8203), 1988 (ICPSR 9256), 1993 (ICPSR 6648), and 1999 (ICPSR 3318). The United States Census Bureau collected the data for the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
The 2006 Census of Jail Facilities gathered data from all jail detention facilities holding inmates beyond arraignment, a period normally exceeding 72 hours. Jail facilities were operated by cities and counties, by private entities under contract to correctional authorities, and by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).
Excluded from the census were physically separate temporary holding facilities such as drunk tanks and police lockups that do not hold persons after being formally charged in court. Also excluded were state-operated facilities in Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Alaska, which have combined jail-prison systems. Fifteen independently operated jails in Alaska were included in the Census.
The census collected jurisdictional level information on the
number of confined inmates; average daily population; number of
separate jail facilities; renovation and building plans; court
orders and consent decrees; staff by occupational category and
race/ethnicity; jail programs; and costs of operation. The
census also collected individual jail facility information on
the purpose for which the jail held offenders; gender of the
inmates authorized to house; functions, such as general adult
population confinement, work release, and medical treatment;
whether a separate temporary holding area or lockup was
operated; rated capacity; number of confined inmates by gender
and adult or juvenile status; year of original construction;
and whether the facility ever had a major renovation.

The respondent universe was derived from a facility list
maintained by the Census Bureau for BJS, from correctional
association directories, and from other secondary sources.
Census forms were sent to each jail jurisdiction. In addition to a paper form, BJS offered respondents an electronic version via the internet, allowing them to complete and submit their completed questionnaires on-line.

Because the census was a complete enumeration, the results were not subject to sampling error. The results were affected, however, by significant item nonresponse. Missing data ranged from 20 percent to 44 percent for average daily population; staff  by full-time and part-time status; gender; race/ethnicity; and occupational category; jail programs; costs of incarceration; and individual jail rated capacity. Complete or nearly complete reporting was recorded on the number of jail facilities, number of jail jurisdictions, type of facility operator, size of jail
jurisdiction and number of jail staff. To estimate the total number of jail employees, nationwide, total reported staff was divided by the number of jurisdictions reporting staff, and the result was multiplied by the total number of jurisdictions.

Data were collected from 84 federal facilities and 1,584
non-federal facilities operating on June 30, 2000.
Universe
View help for Universe
The facility universe was developed from the Census of
State and Federal Correctional Facilities. The list was revised using
the 2000 American Correctional Association Directory and information
obtained from State and private correctional administrators and the
Federal Bureau of Prisons. The Census includes the following types of
state, federal, and private correctional facilities intended for
adults but sometimes also holding juveniles: prisons, penitentiaries,
and correctional institutions, boot camps, community corrections,
prison farms, reception, diagnostic and classification centers, road
camps, forestry and conservation camps, youthful offender facilities
(except in California), vocational training facilities, prison
hospitals, and drug and alcohol treatment facilities for
prisoners. State-operated local detention facilities in Alaska,
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont were also
included. Facilities were included in the census if they: (1) were
staffed with federal, state, local, or private employees, (2) housed
primarily state or federal prisoners, (3) were physically,
functionally, and administratively separate from other facilities, and
(4) were in operation on June 30, 2000. Specifically excluded from the
census were: (1) private facilities not primarily for state or federal
inmates, (2) military facilities, (3) Immigration and Naturalization
Service facilities, (4) Bureau of Indian Affairs facilities, (5)
facilities operated by or for local governments, including those
housing state prisoners, (6) facilities operated by the United States
Marshals Service, (7) hospital wings and wards reserved for state
prisoners, and (8) facilities that hold only juveniles.

The facility universe was developed from the Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities conducted in 2000. Each state's department of corrections was contacted to identify new facilities and facilities that had been closed since June, 2000. Telephone follow-ups were carried out during 2006. All but one respondent -- the state of Illinois -- participated in the census. Facilities were included in the enumeration if they were: (1) staffed with federal, state, local, or private employees, (2) held inmates primarily for state or federal authorities, (3) were physically, functionally, and administratively separate from other facilities, and (4) were operational on December 30, 2005.
The census included the following types of adult correctional facilities:
Prisons
Prison farms
Reception, diagnostic, and classification centers
Facilities primarily for parole violators and other persons returned to custody
Road camps, forestry camps, and conservation camps
Youthful offender facilities except in California
Vocational training facilities
Drug and alcohol treatment facilities
State operated local detention facilities in Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont
The census excluded the following types of institutions:
Private facilities not primarily for state or federal inmates
Military facilities
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities
Bureau of Indian Affairs facilities
Facilities operated by or for local government, including those housing state prisoners
Facilities operated by the United States Marshals Service

Summary
View help for Summary
In 1995-1996, the MacArthur Midlife Research Network
carried out a national survey of 7,108 Americans aged 25 to 74
(MIDLIFE IN THE UNITED STATES (MIDUS),
1995-1996 [
ICPSR 2760
]). The purpose of the study was to investigate
the role of behavioral, psychological, and social factors in
understanding age-related differences in physical and mental
health. The study was innovative for its broad scientific scope, its
diverse samples (which included twins and the siblings of main sample
respondents), and its creative use of in-depth assessments in key
areas (e.g., daily stress and cognitive functioning). A description of
the study and findings from it are available at
http://www.midus.wisc.edu
. With support from the National Institute on Aging, a longitudinal follow-up of the original MIDUS samples: core sample (N = 3,487), metropolitan over-samples (N = 757), twins (N = 925 complete pairs), and siblings (N = 950), was conducted in 2004-2006. Guiding hypotheses for it, at the most
general level, were that behavioral and psychosocial factors are
consequential for physical and mental health. MIDUS 2 respondents were
aged 35 to 86. Data collection largely repeated baseline assessments
(e.g., phone interview and extensive self-administered questionnaire),
with additional questions in selected areas (e.g., cognitive
functioning, optimism and coping, stressful life events, and
caregiving). To add refinements to MIDUS 2, an African American sample
(N = 592) was recruited from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who participated in
a personal interview and completed a questionnaire paralleling the
above assessments. Survey data for the Milwaukee sample are available in a separate project [
ICPSR 22840
]. Also administered was a modified form of the mail questionnaire, via telephone, to respondents who did not complete a
self-administered questionnaire.

The data in this collection can be linked to the following MIDUS studies by using the variable M2ID: ICPSR 2760, 22840, 25281, 26841, 28683, and 29282.
The missing value assignments for the following variables have been reduced from 9-10 digits in length to a maximum of 8 digits in length due to a limitation in Stata: B1SG17A, B1SG18A, B1SG18B, B1SG19A, B1SG21B, B1SG22A, B1SG24A, B1SG25A, B1SG25B, B1SG25C, B1SG25D, B1SG25E, B1SG25F, B1SG25G, B1SG25H, AND B1SG25I.
The DDI codebook (PDF file) and the XML file (contained in a zip package) released by ICPSR were provided by MIDUS and were not changed in any way by ICPSR. These original files do not reflect any of the processing done by ICPSR.
The online analysis (SDA) file is a merged file comprised of the four datasets within this data collection. The files were merged using the variable M2ID. Users of this merged file should review the information in the ""Documentation [PDF] weights"" available through the ICPSR and NACDA Web sites, prior to analysis.
A document pertaining to the naming conventions for this study has been added to the collection.
The title of this study was changed from National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS 2), 2004-2006, to Midlife in the United States (MIDUS 2), 2004-2006, on May 9, 2017.

Methodology
Sample
View help for Sample
The respondents to this study were first interviewed as part of the NATIONAL SURVEY OF MIDLIFE DEVELOPMENT IN THE UNITED STATES (MIDUS), 1995-1996 (
ICPSR 2760
). MIDUS was based on a nationally representative random-digit-dial (RDD) sample of noninstitutionalized, English-speaking adults, aged 25 to 74, selected from working telephone banks in the coterminous United States. Predesignated households were selected in random replicates, one-fourth of which included a special nonrespondent incentive
component. Contact persons were informed that the survey was being carried out through the Harvard Medical School and that it was designed to study health and well-being during the middle years of life. After explaining the study to the informant, a household listing was generated of people in the age range of 25 to 74, and a random respondent was selected. Oversampling of older people and men was achieved by varying the probability of carrying out the interview at this stage as a joint function of the age and sex of the randomly selected respondent. No other person in the household was selected if the respondent did not complete the interview. There was no additional
sampling of cases for the longitudinal component of MIDUS II -- it was a follow-up study and attempted to recontact original MIDUS participants. More information about the MIDUS II sample can be found in the document ""Documentation [PDF] sample_descriptions"", available for download through the ICPSR and NACDA Web sites.

Project Description
Summary
View help for Summary
Since January 1994, the Federal Reserve Board has permitted
depository institutions in the United States to implement so-called
""retail sweep programs."" The essence of these programs is computer
software that dynamically reclassifies customer deposits from
transaction accounts, which are subject to statutory
reserve-requirement ratios as high as 10 percent, to money market
deposit accounts, which have a zero ratio. Through the use of such
software, hundreds of banks have sharply reduced the amount of their
required reserves. In many cases, this new lower requirement places no
constraint on the bank because it is less than the amount of reserves
(vault cash and deposits at the Federal Reserve) that the bank
requires for its ordinary day-to-day business. In the terminology
introduced by the authors in a previous article (see MEASURING THE
ADJUSTED MONETARY BASE IN AN ERA OF FINANCIAL CHANGE [ICPSR 1169]),
such deposit-sweeping activity has allowed these banks to become
""economically nonbound"" and has reduced to zero the economic burden
(""tax"") due to statutory reserve requirements. In this analysis, the
authors examine a large panel of United States banks and develop
quantitative estimates of the impact of sweep software programs on the
demand for bank reserves.

Abstract
A global priority for the behavioural sciences is to develop cost-effective, scalable interventions that could improve the academic outcomes of adolescents at a population level, but no such interventions have so far been evaluated in a population-generalizable sample. Here we show that a short (less than one hour), online growth mindset intervention—which teaches that intellectual abilities can be developed—improved grades among lower-achieving students and increased overall enrolment to advanced mathematics courses in a nationally representative sample of students in secondary education in the United States. Notably, the study identified school contexts that sustained the effects of the growth mindset intervention: the intervention changed grades when peer norms aligned with the messages of the intervention. Confidence in the conclusions of this study comes from independent data collection and processing, pre-registration of analyses, and corroboration of results by a blinded Bayesian analysis.

Main
About 20% of students in the United States will not finish high school on time
1
. These students are at a high risk of poverty, poor health and early mortality in the current global economy
2
,
3
,
4
. Indeed, a
Lancet
commission concluded that improving secondary education outcomes for adolescents “presents the single best investment for health and wellbeing”
5
.
The transition to secondary school represents an important period of flexibility in the educational trajectories of adolescents
6
. In the United States, the grades of students tend to decrease during the transition to the ninth grade (age 14–15 years, UK year 10), and often do not recover
7
. When such students underperform in or opt out of rigorous coursework, they are far less likely to leave secondary school prepared for college or university or for advanced courses in college or university
8
,
9
. In this way, early problems in the transition to secondary school can compound over time into large differences in human capital in adulthood.
One way to improve academic success across the transition to secondary school is through social–psychological interventions, which change how adolescents think or feel about themselves and their schoolwork and thereby encourage students to take advantage of learning opportunities in school
10
,
11
. The specific intervention evaluated here—a growth mindset of intelligence intervention—addresses the beliefs of adolescents about the nature of intelligence, leading students to see intellectual abilities not as fixed but as capable of growth in response to dedicated effort, trying new strategies and seeking help when appropriate
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
16
. This can be especially important in a society that conveys a fixed mindset (a view that intelligence is fixed), which can imply that feeling challenged and having to put in effort means that one is not naturally talented and is unlikely to succeed
12
.
The growth mindset intervention communicates a memorable metaphor: that the brain is like a muscle that grows stronger and smarter when it undergoes rigorous learning experiences
14
. Adolescents hear the metaphor in the context of the neuroscience of learning, they reflect on ways to strengthen their brains through schoolwork, and they internalize the message by teaching it to a future first-year ninth grade student who is struggling at the start of the year. The intervention can lead to sustained academic improvement through self-reinforcing cycles of motivation and learning-oriented behaviour. For example, a growth mindset can motivate students to take on more rigorous learning experiences and to persist when encountering difficulties. Their behaviour may then be reinforced by the school context, such as more positive and learning-oriented responses from peers or instructors
10
,
17
.
Initial intervention studies with adolescents taught a growth mindset in multi-session (for example, eight classroom sessions
15
), interactive workshops delivered by highly trained adults; however, these were not readily scalable. Subsequent growth mindset interventions were briefer and self-administered online, although lower effect sizes were, of course, expected. Nonetheless, previous randomized evaluations, including a pre-registered replication, found that online growth mindset interventions improved grades for the targeted group of students in secondary education who previously showed lower achievement
13
,
16
,
18
. These findings are important because previously low-achieving students are the group that shows the steepest decline in grades during the transition to secondary school
19
, and these findings are consistent with theory because a growth mindset should be most beneficial for students confronting challenges
20
.
Here we report the results of the National Study of Learning Mindsets, which examined the effects of a short, online growth mindset intervention in a nationally representative sample of high schools in the United States (Fig.
1
). With this unique dataset we tested the hypotheses that the intervention would improve grades among lower-achieving students and overall uptake of advanced courses in this national sample.
Fig. 1: Design of the National Study of Learning Mindsets.
Between August and November 2015, 82% of schools delivered the intervention; the remaining 18% delivered the intervention in January or February of 2016. Asterisk indicates that the median number of days between sessions 1 and 2 among schools implementing the intervention in the autumn was 21 days; for spring-implementing schools it was 27 days. The coin-tossing symbol indicates that random assignment was made during session 1. The tick symbol indicates that a comprehensive analysis plan was pre-registered at
https://osf.io/tn6g4
. The blind-eye symbol indicates that, first, teachers and researchers were kept blinded to students’ random assignment to condition, and, second, the Bayesian, machine-learning robustness tests were conducted by analysts who at the time were blinded to study hypotheses and to the identities of the variables.

A focus on heterogeneity
The study was also designed with the purpose of understanding for whom and under what conditions the growth mindset intervention improves grades. That is, it examined potential sources of cross-site treatment effect heterogeneity. One reason why understanding heterogeneity of effects is important is because most interventions that are effective in initial efficacy trials go on to show weaker or no effects when they are scaled up in effectiveness trials that deliver treatments under everyday conditions to more heterogeneous samples
21
,
22
,
23
. Without clear evidence about why average effect sizes differ in later-conducted studies—evidence that could be acquired from a systematic investigation of effect heterogeneity—researchers may prematurely discard interventions that yield low average effects but could provide meaningful and replicable benefits at scale for targeted groups
21
,
23
.
Further, analyses of treatment effect heterogeneity can reveal critical evidence about contextual mechanisms that sustain intervention effects. If school contexts differ in the availability of the resources or experiences needed to sustain the offered belief change and enhanced motivation following an intervention, then the effects of the intervention should differ across these school contexts as well
10
,
11
.
Sociological theory highlights two broad dimensions of school contexts that might sustain or impede belief change and enhanced motivation among students treated by a growth mindset intervention
6
. First, schools with the least ‘formal’ resources, such as high-quality curricula and instruction, may not offer the learning opportunities for students to be able to capitalize on the intervention, while those with the most resources may not need the intervention. Second, some schools may not have the ‘informal’ resources needed to sustain the intervention effect, such as peer norms that support students when they take on challenges and persist in the face of intellectual difficulty. We hypothesized that both of these dimensions would significantly moderate growth mindset intervention effects.
Historically, the scientific methods used to answer questions about the heterogeneity of intervention effects have been underdeveloped and underused
21
,
24
,
25
. Common problems in the literature are: (1) imprecise site-level impact estimates (because of cluster-level random assignment); (2) inconsistent fidelity to intervention protocols across sites (which can obscure the workings of the cross-site moderators of interest); (3) non-representative sampling of sites (which causes site selection bias
22
,
26
); and (4) multiple post hoc tests for the sources of treatment effect size heterogeneity (which increases the probability of false discoveries
24
).
We overcame all of these problems in a single study. We randomized students to condition within schools and consistently had high fidelity of implementation across sites (see
Supplementary Information section 5
). We addressed site selection bias by contracting a professional research company, which recruited a sample of schools that generalized to the entire population of ninth-grade students attending regular US public schools
27
(that is, schools that run on government funds; see
Supplementary Information section 3
). Next, the study used analysis methods that avoided false conclusions about subgroup effects, by generating a limited number of moderation hypotheses (two), pre-registering a limited number of statistical tests and conducting a blinded Bayesian analysis that can provide rigorous confirmation of the results (Fig.
1
).
Expected effect sizes
In this kind of study, it is important to ask what size of effect would be meaningful. As a leading educational economist concluded, “in real-world settings, a fifth of a standard deviation [0.20 s.d.] is a large effect”
28
. This statement is justified by the ‘best evidence synthesis’ movement
29
, which recommends the use of empirical benchmarks, not from laboratory studies, but from the highest-quality field research on factors affecting objective educational outcomes
30
,
31
. A standardized mean difference effect size of 0.20 s.d. is considered ‘large’ because it is: (1) roughly how much improvement results from a year of classroom learning for ninth-grade students, as shown by standardized tests
30
; (2) at the high end of estimates for the effect of having a very high-quality teacher (versus an average teacher) for one year
32
; and (3) at the uppermost end of empirical distributions of real-world effect sizes from diverse randomized trials that target adolescents
31
. Notably, the highly-cited ‘nudges’ studied by behavioural economists and others, when aimed at influencing real-world outcomes that unfold over time (such as college enrolment or energy conservation
33
) rather than one-time choices, rarely, if ever, exceed 0.20 s.d. and typically have much smaller effect sizes.
Returning to educational benchmarks, 0.20 s.d. and 0.23 s.d. were the two largest effects observed in a recent cohort analysis of the results of all of the pre-registered, randomized trials that evaluated promising interventions for secondary schools funded as part of the US federal government’s i3 initiative
34
(the median effect for these promising interventions was 0.03 s.d.; see
Supplementary Information section 11
). The interventions in the i3 initiative typically targeted lower-achieving students or schools, involved training teachers or changing curricula, consumed considerable classroom time, and cost several thousand US dollars per student. Moreover, they were all conducted in non-representative samples of convenience that can overestimate effects. Therefore, it would be noteworthy if a short, low-cost, scalable growth mindset intervention, conducted in a nationally representative sample, could achieve a meaningful proportion of the largest effects seen for past traditional interventions, within the targeted, pre-registered group of lower-achieving students.
Defining the primary outcome and student subgroup
The primary outcome was the post-intervention grade point average (GPA) in core ninth-grade classes (mathematics, science, English or language arts, and social studies), obtained from administrative data sources of the schools (as described in the pre-analysis plan found in the
Supplementary Information section 13
and at
https://osf.io
35
). Following the pre-registered analysis plan, we report results for the targeted group of
n
= 6,320 students who were lower-achieving relative to peers in the same school. This group is typically targeted by comprehensive programmes evaluated in randomized trials in education, as there is an urgent need to improve their educational trajectories. The justification for predicting effects in the lower-achieving group is that (1) this group benefitted in previous growth mindset trials; (2) lower-achieving students may be undergoing more academic difficulties and therefore may benefit more from a growth mindset that alters the interpretation of these difficulties; and (3) students who already have a high GPA may have less room to improve their GPAs. We defined students as relatively lower-achieving if they were earning GPAs at or below the school-specific median in the term before random assignment or, if they were missing prior GPA data, if they were below the school-specific median on academic variables used to impute prior GPA (as described in the analysis plan). Supplementary analyses for the sample overall can be found in Extended Data Table
1
, and robustness analyses for the definition of lower-achieving students are included in Extended Data Fig.
1
(
Supplementary Information section 7
).
Average effects on mindset
Among lower-achieving adolescents, the growth mindset intervention reduced the prevalence of fixed mindset beliefs relative to the control condition, reported at the end of the second treatment session, unstandardized
B
= −0.38 (95% confidence interval = −0.31, −0.46), standard error of the regression coefficient (s.e.) = 0.04,
n
= 5,650 students,
k
= 65 schools,
t
= −10.14,
P
< 0.001, standardized mean difference effect size of 0.33.
Average effects on core course GPAs
In line with our first major prediction, lower-achieving adolescents earned higher GPAs in core classes at the end of the ninth grade when assigned to the growth mindset intervention,
B =
0.10 grade points (95% confidence interval = 0.04, 0.16), s.e. = 0.03,
n
= 6,320,
k
= 65,
t
= 3.51,
P
= 0.001, standardized mean difference effect size of 0.11, relative to comparable students in the control condition. This conclusion is robust to alternative model specifications that deviate from the pre-registered model (Extended Data Fig.
1
).
To map the growth mindset intervention effect onto a policy-relevant indicator of high school success, we analysed poor performance rates, defined as the percentage of adolescents who earned a GPA below 2.0 on a four-point scale (that is, a ‘D’ or an ‘F’; as described in the pre-analysis plan). Poor performance rates are relevant because recent changes in US federal laws (the Every Student Succeeds Act
36
), have led many states to adopt reductions in the poor performance rates in the ninth grade as a key metric for school accountability. More than three million ninth-grade students attend regular US public schools each year, and half are lower-achieving according to our definition. The model estimates that 5.3% (95% confidence interval = −1.7, −9.0), s.e. = 1.8,
t
= 2.95,
P
= 0.005 of 1.5 million students in the United States per year would be prevented from being ‘off track’ for graduation by the brief and low-cost growth mindset intervention, representing a reduction from 46% to 41%, which is a relative risk reduction of 11% (that is, 0.05/0.46).
Average effects on mathematics and science GPAs
A secondary analysis focused on the outcome of GPAs in only mathematics and science (as described in the analysis plan). Mathematics and science are relevant because a popular belief in the United States links mathematics and science learning to ‘raw’ or ‘innate’ abilities
37
—a view that the growth mindset intervention seeks to correct. In addition, success in mathematics and science strongly predicts long-term economic welfare and well-being
38
. Analyses of outcomes for mathematics and science supported the same conclusions (
B
= 0.10 for mathematics and science GPAs compared to
B
= 0.10 for core GPAs; Extended Data Tables
1
–
3
).
Quantifying heterogeneity
The intervention was expected to homogeneously change the mindsets of students across schools—as this would indicate high fidelity of implementation—however, it was expected to heterogeneously change lower-achieving students’ GPAs, as this would indicate potential school differences in the contextual mechanisms that sustain an initial treatment effect. As predicted, a mixed-effects model found no significant variability in the treatment effect on self-reported mindsets across schools (unstandardized
\(\hat{\tau }=0.08\)
,
Q
64
= 57.2,
P
= 0.714), whereas significant variability was found in the effect on GPAs among lower-achieving students across schools (unstandardized
\(\hat{\tau }=0.09\)
,
Q
64
= 85.5,
P
= 0.038)
39
(Extended Data Fig.
2
).
Moderation by school achievement level
First, we tested competing hypotheses about whether the formal resources of the school explained the heterogeneity of effects. Before analysing the data, we expected that in schools that are unable to provide high-quality learning opportunities (the lowest-achieving schools), treated students might not sustain a desire to learn. But we also expected that other schools (the highest-achieving schools) might have such ample resources to prevent failure such that a growth mindset intervention would not add much.
The heterogeneity analyses found support for the latter expectation, but not the former. Treatment effects on ninth-grade GPAs among lower-achieving students were smaller in schools with higher achievement levels, intervention × school achievement level (continuous) interaction, unstandardized
B
= −0.07 (95% confidence interval = 0.02, 0.13), s.e. = 0.03,
z
= −2.76,
n
= 6,320,
k
= 65,
P
= 0.006, standardized
β
= −0.25. In follow-up analyses with categorical indicators for school achievement, medium-achieving schools (middle 50%) showed larger effects than higher-achieving schools (top 25%). Low-achieving schools (bottom 25%) did not significantly differ from medium-achieving schools (Extended Data Table
2
); however, this non-significant difference should be interpreted cautiously, owing to wide confidence intervals for the subgroup of lowest-achieving schools.
Moderation by peer norms
Second, we examined whether students might be discouraged from acting on their enhanced growth mindset when they attend schools in which peer norms were unsupportive of challenge-seeking, whereas peer norms that support challenge-seeking might function to sustain the effects of the intervention over time. We measured peer norms by administering a behavioural challenge-seeking task (the ‘make-a-math-worksheet’ task) at the end of the second intervention session (Fig.
1
) and aggregating the values of the control group to the school level.
The pre-registered mixed-effects model yielded a positive and significant intervention × behavioural challenge-seeking norms interaction for GPA among the targeted group of lower-achieving adolescents, such that the intervention produced a greater difference in end-of-year GPAs relative to the control group when the behavioural norm that surrounded students was supportive of the growth mindset belief system,
B
= 0.11 (95% confidence interval = 0.01, 0.21), s.e. = 0.05,
z
= 2.18,
n
= 6,320,
k
= 65,
P
= 0.029,
β
= 0.23. The same conclusion was supported in a secondary analysis of only mathematics and science GPAs (Extended Data Table
2
).
Subgroup effect sizes
Putting together the two pre-registered moderators (school achievement level and school norms), the conditional average treatment effect (CATEs) on core GPAs within low- and medium-achieving schools (combined) was 0.14 grade points when the school was in the third quartile of behavioural norms and 0.18 grade points when the school was in the fourth and highest quartile of behavioural norms, as shown in Fig.
2
. For mathematics and science grades, the CATEs ranged from 0.16 to 0.25 grade points in the same subgroups of low- and medium-achieving schools with more supportive behavioural norms (for results separating low- and medium-achieving schools, see Fig.
2c, d
and Extended Data Table
3
). We also found that even the high-achieving schools showed meaningful treatment effects among their lower achievers on mathematics and science GPAs when they had norms that supported challenge seeking—0.08 and 0.11 grade points for the third and fourth quartiles of school norms, respectively, in the high-achieving schools (
P
= 0.002; Extended Data Table
3
).

Bayesian robustness analysis
A team of statisticians, at the time blind to study hypotheses, re-analysed the dataset using a conservative Bayesian machine-learning algorithm, called Bayesian causal forest (BCF). BCF has been shown by both its creators and other leading statisticians in open head-to-head competitions to be the most effective of the state-of-the-art methods for identifying systematic sources of treatment effect heterogeneity, while avoiding false positives
40
,
41
.
The BCF analysis assigned a near-certain posterior probability that the population-average treatment effect (PATE) among lower-achieving students was positive and greater than zero,
P
PATE > 0
≥ 0.999, providing strong evidence of positive average treatment effects. BCF also found stronger CATEs in schools with positive challenge-seeking norms, and weaker effects in the highest-achieving schools (Extended Data Fig.
3
and
Supplementary Information section 8
), providing strong correspondence with the primary analyses.
Advanced mathematics course enrolment in tenth grade
The intervention showed weaker benefits on ninth-grade GPAs in high-achieving schools. However, students in these schools may benefit in other ways. An analysis of enrolment in rigorous mathematics courses in the year after the intervention examined this possibility. The enrolment data were gathered with these analyses in mind but since the analyses were not pre-registered, they are exploratory.
Course enrolment decisions are potentially relevant to all students, both lower- and higher-achieving, so we explored them in the full cohort. We found that the growth mindset intervention increased the likelihood of students taking advanced mathematics (algebra II or higher) in tenth grade by 3 percentage points (95% confidence interval = 0.01, 0.04), s.e. = 0.01,
n

k

t
= 3.18,
P
= 0.001, from a rate of 33% in the control condition to a rate of 36% in the intervention condition, corresponding to a 9% relative increase. Notably, we discovered a positive intervention × school achievement level (continuous) interaction, (
B
= 0.04 (95% confidence interval = 0.00, 0.08), s.e. = 0.02,
z
= 2.26,
P
= 0.024, the opposite of what we found for core course GPAs. Within the highest-achieving 25% of schools, the intervention increased the rate at which students took advanced mathematics in tenth grade by 4 percentage points (
t
= 2.37,
P
= 0.018). In the lower 75% of schools—where we found stronger effects on GPA—the increase in the rate at which students took advanced mathematics courses was smaller: 2 percentage points (
t
= 2.00,
P
= 0.045). Thus an exclusive focus on GPA would have obscured intervention benefits among students attending higher-achieving schools.
Discussion
The National Study of Learning Mindsets showed that a low-cost treatment, delivered in less than an hour, attained a substantial proportion of the effects on grades of the most effective rigorously evaluated adolescent interventions of any cost or duration in the literature within the pre-registered group of lower-achieving students. Moreover, the intervention produced gains in the consequential outcome of advanced mathematics course-taking for students overall, which is meaningful because the rigor of mathematics courses taken in high school strongly predicts later educational attainment
8
,
9
, and educational attainment is one of the leading predictors of longevity and health
38
,
42
. The finding that the growth mindset intervention could redirect critical academic outcomes to such an extent—with no training of teachers; in an effectiveness trial conducted in a population-generalizable sample; with data collected by an independent research company using repeatable procedures; with data processed by a second independent research company; and while adhering to a comprehensive pre-registered analysis plan—is a major advance.
Furthermore, the evidence about the kinds of schools where the growth mindset treatment effect on grades was sustained, and where it was not, has important implications for future interventions. We might have expected that the intervention would compensate for unsupportive school norms, and that students who already had supportive peer norms would not need the intervention as much. Instead, it was when the peer norm supported the adoption of intellectual challenges that the intervention promoted sustained benefits in the form of higher grades.
Perhaps students in unsupportive peer climates risked paying a social price for taking on intellectual challenges in front of peers who thought it undesirable to do so. Sustained change may therefore require both a high-quality seed (an adaptive belief system conveyed by a compelling intervention) and conductive soil in which that seed can grow (a context congruent with the proffered belief system). A limitation of our moderation results, of course, is that we cannot draw causal conclusions about the effects of the school norm, as the norms were measured, not manipulated. It is encouraging that a Bayesian analysis, reported in the Supplementary Information section 8, yielded evidence consistent with a causal interpretation of the school norms variable. The present research therefore sets the stage for a new era of experimental research that seeks to enhance both students’ mindsets and the school environments that support student learning.
We emphasize that not all forms of growth mindset interventions can be expected to increase grades or advanced course-taking, even in the targeted subgroups
11
,
12
. New growth mindset interventions that go beyond the module and population tested here will need to be subjected to rigorous development and validation processes, as the current programme was
13
.
Finally, this study offers lessons for the science of adolescent behaviour change. Beliefs—and particularly beliefs that affect how students make sense of ongoing challenges—are important during high-stakes developmental turning points such as pubertal maturation
43
,
44
or the transition to secondary school
6
. Indeed, new interventions in the future should address the interpretation of other challenges that adolescents experience, including social and interpersonal difficulties, to affect outcomes (such as depression) that thus far have proven difficult to address
43
. And the combined importance of belief change and school environments in our study underscores the need for interdisciplinary research to understand the numerous influences on adolescents’ developmental trajectories.
Methods
Ethics approval
Approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board at Stanford University (30387), ICF (FWA00000845), and the University of Texas at Austin (#2016-03-0042). In most schools this experiment was conducted as a programme evaluation carried out at the request of the participating school district
45
. When required by school districts, parents were informed of the programme evaluation in advance and given the opportunity to withdraw their children from the study. Informed student assent was obtained from all participants.
Participants
Data came from the National Study of Learning Mindsets
45
, which is a stratified random sample of 65 regular public schools in the United States that included 12,490 ninth-grade adolescents who were individually randomized to condition. The number of schools invited to participate was determined by a power analysis to detect reasonable estimates of cross-site heterogeneity; as many of the invited schools as possible were recruited into the study. Grades were obtained from the schools of the students, and analyses focused on the lower-achieving subgroup of students (those below the within-school median). The sample reflected the diversity of young people in the United States: 11% self-reported being black/African-American, 4% Asian-American, 24% Latino/Latina, 43% white and 18% another race or ethnicity; 29% reported that their mother had a bachelor’s degree or higher. To prevent deductive disclosure for potentially-small subgroups of students, and consistent with best practices for other public-use datasets, the policies for the National Study of Learning Mindsets require analysts to round all sample sizes to the nearest 10, so this was done here.
Data collection
To ensure that the study procedures were repeatable by third parties and therefore scalable, and to increase the independence of the results, two different professional research companies, who were not involved in developing the materials or study hypotheses, were contracted. One company (ICF) drew the sample, recruited schools, arranged for treatment delivery, supervised and implemented the data collection protocol, obtained administrative data, and cleaned and merged data. They did this work blind to the treatment conditions of the students. This company worked in concert with a technology vendor (PERTS), which delivered the intervention, executed random assignment, tracked student response rates, scheduled make-up sessions and kept all parties blind to condition assignment. A second professional research company (MDRC) processed the data merged by ICF and produced an analytic grades file, blind to the consequences of their decisions for the estimated treatment effects, as described in
Supplementary Information section 12
. Those data were shared with the authors of this paper, who analysed the data following a pre-registered analysis plan (see
Supplementary Information section 13
; MDRC will later produce its own independent report using its processed data, and retained the right to deviate from our pre-analysis plan).
Selection of schools was stratified by school achievement and minority composition. A simple random sample would not have yielded sufficient numbers of rare types of schools, such as high-minority schools with medium or high levels of achievement. This was because school achievement level—one of the two candidate moderators—was strongly associated with school racial/ethnic composition
46
(percentage of Black/African-American or Hispanic/Latino/Latina students,
r
= −0.66).
A total of 139 schools were selected without replacement from a sampling frame of roughly 12,000 regular US public high schools, which serve the vast majority of students in the United States. Regular US public schools exclude charter or private schools, schools serving speciality populations such as students with physical disabilities, alternative schools, schools that have fewer than 25 ninth-grade students enrolled and schools in which ninth grade is not the lowest grade in the school.
Of the 139 schools, 65 schools agreed, participated and provided student records. Another 11 schools agreed and participated but did not provide student grades or course-taking records; therefore, the data of their students are not analysed here. School nonresponse did not appear to compromise representativeness. We calculated the Tipton generalizability index
47
, a measure of similarity between an analytic sample and the overall sampling frame, along eight student demographic and school achievement benchmarks obtained from official government sources
27
. The index ranges from 0 to 1, with a value of 0.90 corresponding to essentially a random sample. The National Study of Learning Mindsets showed a Tipton generalizability index of 0.98, which is very high (see
Supplementary Information section 3
).
Within schools, the average student response rate for eligible students was 92% and the median school had a response rate of 98% (see definitions in
Supplementary Information section 5
). This response rate was obtained by extensive efforts to recruit students into make-up sessions if students were absent and it was aided by a software system, developed by the technology vendor (PERTS), that kept track of student participation. A high within-school response rate was important because lower-achieving students, our target group, are typically more likely to be absent.
Growth mindset intervention content
In preparing the intervention to be scalable, we revised past growth mindset interventions to focus on the perspectives, concerns and reading levels of ninth-grade students in the United States, through an intensive research and development process that involved interviews, focus groups and randomized pilot experiments with thousands of adolescents
13
.
The control condition, focusing on brain functions, was similar to the growth mindset intervention, but did not address beliefs about intelligence. Screenshots from both interventions can be found in
Supplementary Information section 4
, and a detailed description of the general intervention content has previously been published
13
. The intervention consisted of two self-administered online sessions that lasted approximately 25 min each and occurred roughly 20 days apart during regular school hours (Fig.
1
).
The growth mindset intervention aimed to reduce the negative effort beliefs of students (the belief that having to try hard or ask for help means you lack ability), fixed-trait attributions (the attribution that failure stems from low ability) and performance avoidance goals (the goal of never looking stupid). These are the documented mediators of the negative effect of a fixed mindset on grades
12
,
15
,
48
and the growth mindset intervention aims to reduce them. The intervention did not only contradict these beliefs but also used a series of interesting and guided exercises to reduce their credibility.
The first session of the intervention covered the basic idea of a growth mindset—that an individual’s intellectual abilities can be developed in response to effort, taking on challenging work, improving one’s learning strategies, and asking for appropriate help. The second session invited students to deepen their understanding of this idea and its application in their lives. Notably, students were not told outright that they should work hard or employ particular study or learning strategies. Rather, effort and strategy revision were described as general behaviours through which students could develop their abilities and thereby achieve their goals.
The materials presented here sought to make the ideas compelling and help adolescents to put them into practice. It therefore featured stories from both older students and admired adults about a growth mindset, and interactive sections in which students reflected on their own learning in school and how a growth mindset could help a struggling ninth-grade student next year. The intervention style is described in greater detail in a paper reporting the pilot study for the present research
13
and in a recent review article
12
.
Among these features, our intervention mentioned effort as one means to develop intellectual ability. Although we cannot isolate the effect of the growth mindset message from a message about effort alone, it is unlikely that the mere mention of effort to high school students would be sufficient to increase grades and challenge seeking. In part this is because adolescents often already receive a great deal of pressure from adults to try hard in school.
Intervention delivery and fidelity
The intervention and control sessions were delivered as early in the school year as possible, to increase the opportunity to set in motion a positive self-reinforcing cycle. In total 82% of students received the intervention in the autumn semester before the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States (that is, before late November) and the rest received the intervention in January or February; see
Supplementary Information section 5
for more detail. The computer software of the technology vendor randomly assigned adolescents to intervention or control materials. Students also answered various survey questions. All parties were blind to condition assignment, and students and teachers were not told the purpose of the study to prevent expectancy effects.
The data collection procedures yielded high implementation fidelity across the participating schools, according to metrics listed in the pre-registered analysis plan. In the median school, treated students viewed 97% of screens and wrote a response for 96% of open-ended questions. In addition, in the median school 91% students reported that most or all of their peers worked carefully and quietly on the materials. Fidelity statistics are reported in full in
Supplementary Information section 5.6
; Extended Data Table
2
shows that the treatment effect heterogeneity conclusions were unchanged when controlling for the interaction of treatment and school-level fidelity as intended.
Measures
Self-reported fixed mindset
Students indicated how much they agreed with three statements such as “You have a certain amount of intelligence, and you really can’t do much to change it” (1, strongly disagree; 6, strongly agree). Higher values corresponded to a more fixed mindset; the pre-analysis plan predicted that the intervention would reduce these self-reports.
GPAs
. Schools provided the grades of each student in each course for the eight and ninth grade. Decisions about which courses counted for which content area were made independently by a research company (MDRC; see
Supplementary Information section 12
). The GPAs are a theoretically relevant outcome because grades are commonly understood to reflect sustained motivation, rather than only prior knowledge. It is also a practically relevant outcome because, as noted, GPA is a strong predictor of adult educational attainment, health and well-being, even when controlling for high school test scores
38
.
School achievement level
The school achievement level moderator was a latent variable that was derived from publicly available indicators of the performance of the school on state and national tests and related factors
45
,
46
, standardized to have mean = 0 and s.d. = 1 in the population of the more than 12,000 US public schools.
Behavioural challenge-seeking norms of the schools
The challenge-seeking norm of each school was assessed through a behavioural measure called the make-a-math-worksheet task
13
. Students completed the task towards the end of the second session, after having completed the intervention or control content. They chose from mathematical problems that were described either as challenging and offering the chance to learn a lot or as easy and not leading to much learning. Students were told that they could complete the problems at the end of the session if there was time. The school norm was estimated by taking the average number of challenging mathematical problems that adolescents in the control condition attending a given school chose to work on. Evidence for the validity of the challenge-seeking norm is presented in the
Supplementary Information section 10
.
Norms of self-reported mindset of the schools
A parallel analysis focused on norms for self-reported mindsets in each school, defined as the average fixed mindset self-reports (described above) of students before random assignment. The private beliefs of peers were thought to be less likely to be visible and therefore less likely to induce conformity and moderate treatment effects, relative to peer behaviours
49
; hence self-reported beliefs were not expected to be significant moderators. Self-reported mindset norms did not yield significant moderation (see Extended Data Table
2
).
Course enrolment to advanced mathematics
We analysed data from 41 schools who provided data that allowed us to calculate rates at which students took an advanced mathematics course (that is, algebra II or higher) in tenth grade, the school year after the intervention. Six additional schools provided tenth grade course-taking data but did not differentiate among mathematics courses. We expected average effects of the treatment on challenging course taking in tenth grade to be small because not all students were eligible for advanced mathematics and not all schools allow students to change course pathways. However, some students might have made their way into more advanced mathematics classes or remained in an advanced pathway rather than dropping to an easier pathway. These challenge-seeking decisions are potentially relevant to both lower- and higher-achieving students, so we explored them in the full sample of students in the 41 included schools.
Analysis methods
Overview
We used intention-to-treat analyses; this means that data were analysed for all students who were randomized to an experimental condition and whose outcome data could be linked. A complier average causal effects analysis yielded the same conclusions but had slightly larger effect sizes (see
Supplementary Information section 9
). Here we report only the more conservative intention-to-treat effect sizes. Standardized effect sizes reported here were standardized mean difference effect sizes and were calculated by dividing the treatment effect coefficients by the raw standard deviation of the control group for the outcome, which is the typical effect size estimate in education evaluation experiments. Frequentist
P
values reported throughout are always from two-tailed hypothesis tests.
Model for average treatment effects
Analyses to estimate average treatment effects for an individual person used a cluster-robust fixed-effects linear regression model with school as fixed effect that incorporated weights provided by statisticians from ICF, with cluster defined as the primary sampling unit. Coefficients were therefore generalizable to the population of inference, which is students attending regular public schools in the United States. For the
t
distribution, the degrees of freedom is 46, which is equal to the number of clusters (or primary sampling units, which was 51) minus the number of sampling strata (which was 5)
45
.
Model for the heterogeneity of effects
To examine cross-school heterogeneity in the treatment effect among lower-achieving students, we estimated multilevel mixed effects models (level 1, students; level 2, schools) with fixed intercepts for schools and a random slope that varied across schools, following current recommended practices
39
. The model included school-centred student-level covariates (prior performance and demographics; see the
Supplementary Information section 7
) to make site-level estimates as precise as possible. This analysis controlled for school-level average student racial/ethnic composition and its interaction with the treatment status variable to account for confounding of student body racial/ethnic composition with school achievement levels. Student body racial/ethnic composition interactions were never significant at
P
< 0.05 and so we do not discuss them further (but they were always included in the models, as pre-registered).
Bayesian robustness analysis
A final pre-registered robustness analysis was conducted to reduce the influence of two possible sources of bias: awareness of study hypotheses when conducting analyses and misspecification of the regression model (see the
Supplemental Information, section 13, p. 12
). Statisticians who were not involved in the study design and unaware of the moderation hypotheses re-analysed a blinded dataset that masked the identities of the variables. They did so using an algorithm that has emerged as a leading approach for understanding moderators of treatments: BCF
40
. The BCF algorithm uses machine learning tools to discover (or rule out) higher-order interactions and nonlinear relations among covariates and moderators. It is conservative because it uses regularization and strong prior distributions to prevent false discoveries. Evidence for the robustness of the moderation analysis in our pre-registered model comes from correspondence with the estimated moderator effects of BCF in the part of the distribution where there are the most schools (that is, in the middle of the distribution), because this is where the BCF algorithm is designed to have confidence in its estimates (Extended Data Fig.
3
).

Extended data figures and tables
Extended Data Fig. 1 The finding that the growth mindset effect on GPA is positive among lower-achieving students is robust to deviations from the pre-registered statistical model.
a
,
b
, Each estimate represents an unstandardized treatment effect on GPA (on a 0 to 4.3 scale) estimated in separate fixed-effects regression models with school as a fixed effect. Most of the alternative specifications were known to produce less-valid tests of the hypothesis, but some of them required fewer subjective judgments and so it was informative to show that the main conclusion of a positive treatment effect was supported even with a suboptimal model specification. Examples include revising the core GPA outcome to include non-core classes such as speech, debate or electives (because this does not involve coding of core classes; see ‘Includes Non-Core Courses’), or revising the post-treatment marking period to include pre-treatment data in cases in which schools implemented the intervention in the Spring (because this does not involve coding pre- and post-treatment making periods; see ‘Includes Some Pre-Treatment GPA’).
a
, The effects of changing just one or two model specifications at a time while leaving the rest of the pre-registered model specifications the same. Open circles represent the pre-registered definition of lower-achieving students (below the school-specific median), and filled dots represent the alternative definition of lower-achieving students (below the school-specific median and below a 3.0 GPA out of 4.3).
b
, A histogram of all possible combinations of the alternative model specifications that shows that effects are uniformly positive. Note that the treatment effect estimates on the far left of
b
are from clearly less-valid models; for example, they insufficiently control for prior achievement, they drop participants with missing data, they do not use survey weights (so results are not representative and therefore do not answer our research questions). Panels
a
and
b
both show that even exercising all of these degrees of freedom in a way that could obscure true treatment effects still yields positive point estimates. Further explanations of why the alternatives were not selected for the pre-registration are included in
Supplementary Information section 7.3

Source data
Extended Data Fig. 2 The growth mindset intervention effect in a given school is almost always positive, although there is significant heterogeneity across schools.
a
,
b
, Mindset treatment effects on for core course GPAs (
a
) and mathematics/science GPAs (
b
). Estimates were generated using the pre-registered linear mixed-effects model (see
Supplementary Information section 7
, RQ3). Note that the treatment effect at any individual school is likely to have a very wide confidence interval even when there is a true positive effect, owing to small sample sizes for each school on its own. Therefore, as with any multi-site trial, effects of individual schools are not expected to be significantly different from zero even though the average treatment effect is significantly different from zero. The plotted treatment effects were estimated in an unconditional model with no cross-level interactions (that is, without consideration of the potential moderators) and so the points are shrunken towards the sample mean. Thus, these plotted estimates do not correspond to the estimated CATEs reported in the paper or in Extended Data Table

Source data
Extended Data Fig. 3 A BCF analysis reproduces the same pattern of moderation by norms as the pre-registered linear mixed-effects model
The BCF analysis uses a nonparametric Bayesian model designed to shrink effect sizes to see if any effect can update a relatively strong prior centered on null effects and biased toward low degrees of treatment effect moderation.
a
,
b
, Data points correspond to school-level treatment effects estimated by the pre-registered linear mixed-effects model (
a
) or the BCF model (
b
). Treatment effects refers to the difference between the treatment and control groups in terms of mathematics/science GPAs at the end of ninth grade in a school, adjusting for pre-random-assignment covariates and including survey weights. The models included three school-level moderators of the student-level randomized treatment: the achievement level (categorical, dummies for low and high, medium group as the reference category in the linear model), the behavioural growth mindset norms (continuous) and the percentage of racial or ethnic minority students (continuous) of the schools. School-level treatment effects include the fitted values plus the model-estimated, school-specific random effect. Challenge-seeking behavioural norm refers to the average number of challenging mathematics problems (out of 8) chosen by students in the control group in a given school.
N
, the number of lower-achieving students in a school. Percent minority, the percentage of students who identify as black, African-American, Hispanic, Latino or indigenous American, split at the school-level population median (26% of the student body of the school). The dashed lines represent the estimated intercept and slope for the linear trend of the estimated treatment effects in norms.
b
, The coloured lines represent LOESS smoothing curves for the trend in  norms of the estimated treatment effects, fitted to the estimated school-level treatment effects within achievement groups and weighted by school sample size. The area between thevertical lines is the interquartile range (IQR) of norms, where neither model is extrapolating. The two models agree broadly about average effects, particularly within the IQR of norms, while BCF estimated somewhat lower degrees of heterogeneity and extrapolates in a fundamentally different fashion at the extremes of norms (since it is a nonlinear model).Recall BCF is designed to shrink toward an overall effect size of zero, and to shrink CATEs of similar schools towards one another, in order to avoid over-fitting the data. Unlike the preregistered linear models, BCF was specified with no prior hypotheses about the functional form of moderation (nonlinearities and/or interactions between multiple moderators and treatment) so this shrinkage is necessary to obtain stable estimates of treatment effects. However, it does lead to smaller estimates of effect sizes and a lower estimated degree of moderation relative to the preregistered linear mixed effects model.

Article Abstract
Background: The economic burden of depression in the United States—including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, and dysthymia—was estimated at $83.1 billion in 2000. We update these findings using recent data, focusing on MDD alone and accounting for comorbid physical and psychiatric disorders.
Method: Using national survey (DSM-IV criteria) and administrative claims data (ICD-9 codes), we estimate the incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD as well as the share of these costs attributable to MDD, with attention to any changes that occurred between 2005 and 2010.
Results: The incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD increased by 21.5% (from $173.2 billion to $210.5 billion, inflation-adjusted dollars). The composition of these costs remained stable, with approximately 45% attributable to direct costs, 5% to suicide-related costs, and 50% to workplace costs. Only 38% of the total costs were due to MDD itself as opposed to comorbid conditions.
Conclusions: Comorbid conditions account for the largest portion of the growing economic burden of MDD. Future research should analyze further these comorbidities as well as the relative importance of factors contributing to that growing burden. These include population growth, increase in MDD prevalence, increase in treatment cost per individual with MDD, changes in employment and treatment rates, as well as changes in the composition and quality of MDD treatment services.

ABSTRACT
Background:
The economic burden of depression in the United States—including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, and dysthymia—was estimated at $83.1 billion in 2000. We update these findings using recent data, focusing on MDD alone and accounting for comorbid physical and psychiatric disorders.
Method:
Using national survey (
DSM-IV
criteria) and administrative claims data (
ICD-9
codes), we estimate the incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD as well as the share of these costs attributable to MDD, with attention to any changes that occurred between 2005 and 2010.
Results:
The incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD increased by 21.5% (from $173.2 billion to $210.5 billion, inflation-adjusted dollars). The composition of these costs remained stable, with approximately 45% attributable to direct costs, 5% to suicide-related costs, and 50% to workplace costs. Only 38% of the total costs were due to MDD itself as opposed to comorbid conditions.
Conclusions:
Comorbid conditions account for the largest portion of the growing economic burden of MDD. Future research should analyze further these comorbidities as well as the relative importance of factors contributing to that growing burden. These include population growth, increase in MDD prevalence, increase in treatment cost per individual with MDD, changes in employment and treatment rates, as well as changes in the composition and quality of MDD treatment services.

epression is among the most burdensome disorders worldwide, giving rise to considerable adverse effects on activities of daily living for extended periods of time.
1
,
2
In the United States, it is a leading cause of disability for people aged 15-44 years, resulting in almost 400 million disability days per year, substantially more than most other physical and mental conditions.
3
,
4
The economic burden of depression, including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, and dysthymia, was estimated at $83.1 billion in 2000 in the United States.
5
This total was composed of $26.1 billion in direct medical costs, $5.4 billion in suicide-related mortality costs, and $51.5 billion in indirect workplace costs (absenteeism from work and presenteeism while at work).
5
Several subsequent studies have quantified specific components of the cost of depression, such as workplace costs or outpatient treatment costs.
6-8
Other studies have analyzed the economic burden of closely related conditions, such as treatment-resistant depression.
9
However, no study has attempted to quantify the overall economic burden of MDD. In addition, although recent literature highlights the importance of comorbidities among people with depression,
10
,
11
prior estimates focused on the cost of depression alone, with no attention to the added economic burden from physical and psychiatric comorbidities.
5
,
12
The objectives of the current study are to examine (1) excess costs incurred by adults with compared to those without MDD having otherwise similar profiles, (2) the portion of these costs attributable to MDD itself as opposed to comorbid conditions, and (3) the relative importance of the different components of the overall economic burden of MDD, with attention to direct costs, suicide-related costs, and workplace costs. In doing so, we update previous research with attention to any changes that occurred between 2005 and 2010. In the absence of a single database from which to draw, we rely on findings from the literature to supplement original results.
METHOD
Key elements of the method are described below. Our framework for evaluating the economic burden of adults with MDD is also summarized in
Supplementary eTable 1
.
Prevalence Data
Prevalence rates by gender, age, employment, and treatment status relied on the 2005 and 2010 updates to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), a national probability sample of the adult US civilian, noninstitutionalized population.
13
,
14
In the NSDUH depression module, adult respondents were asked questions adapted from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication,
15
,
16
which was based on World Health Organization World Mental Health Survey Initiative version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. On the basis of these responses,
DSM-IV
criteria
17
were used to identify people with a past-year major depressive episode (MDE), defined as symptoms occurring for a period of 2 weeks or longer over the past 12 months among those with lifetime MDE.

Individuals aged 18-64 years with diagnosed MDD in 2005 or 2010 (study years) were selected from the OptumHealth Reporting and Insights administrative claims database.
19
,
20
This private insurance database includes over 16 million beneficiaries (ie, employees, spouses, and dependents) from 69 large, self-insured US companies. Patients with MDD were included for analysis if they had at least 2
ICD-9-CM
claims for MDD—296.2 (single episode) or 296.3 (recurrent episode)—occurring on different dates during 1 of the 2 study years. To ensure that a complete claims history was available, each patient was required to have continuous health care eligibility during the study period. Patients with MDD having health maintenance organization, capitated, or Medicare coverage were excluded from the analysis because payment information may be incomplete for these patients. Controls with no diagnosis of MDD and no prescription for antidepressant or antipsychotic/antimanic drugs during the study years were selected using similar criteria.
The cost of major depressive disorder in the United States is known to be substantial, but little attention has been given to the added economic burden from physical and psychiatric comorbidities.
Comorbid conditions account for the largest portion of the growing economic burden of major depressive disorder and should be considered in the treatment of the disease.
For each study year, patients with MDD were matched 1-to-1 to controls using a combination of direct characteristic matching and propensity score analysis. Specifically, patients were matched directly by age, gender, region, insurance type, employment status, relationship to primary beneficiary, and Charlson Comorbidity Index
21
,
22
and by propensity score using a caliper of 0.25 standard deviations of the propensity score. The propensity score was calculated using a logistic regression with controls for the most frequently observed general physical comorbidities that were found to be statistically significantly different at baseline between MDD patients and controls and that were not known to be MDD related.
23-25
For example, we controlled for hypertension, which has no reported association with MDD, but did not control for back pain since we wanted to capture the incremental costs of this condition, which has been documented as MDD related (despite the ambiguity of the causal direction). Detailed comparisons of characteristics of MDD patients and controls before and after patient matching in both study years are presented in
Supplementary eTables 2-5
.
Direct Costs Estimation
Average costs per patient, including medical services and prescription drug costs, were calculated in the 2 study years for both MDD and control patients. Three categories of costs were estimated: (1) MDD costs, including costs that occurred on the same day and in the same location as a medical claim with an MDD diagnosis, as well as pharmaceutical costs for antidepressant and antipsychotic/antimanic drugs; (2) other depression costs, including medical costs that occurred on the same day and in the same location as a medical claim with a diagnosis for another type of depression but not MDD specifically, as well as pharmaceutical costs for antianxiety and anticonvulsant drugs; and (3) nondepression costs, including all costs not captured in the first 2 categories. Incremental costs were calculated in each study year by subtracting average costs of controls from those of MDD patients. While the first cost category was the basis for estimating the
direct costs of MDD
, attention to all 3 categories taken together yielded an estimate of the
direct costs of individuals with MDD
.
Direct costs were estimated according to employment and MDD treatment status: (1) employed and treated—costs estimated from claims data; (2) employed and not treated—MDD costs set equal to 0, and non-MDD costs (the second and third cost categories above) set equal to those incurred by employed and treated patients; and (3) not employed (treated or not treated)—costs assumed to be 1.7 times those found in the employed population based on the ratio of health care costs incurred by MDD patients in a Medicaid population compared with a privately insured population.
26
(See
Supplementary eTable 6
for detailed calculation of ratios used to infer missing cost categories.) Since the direct costs of MDD for people aged ≥ 65 years could not be observed in these claims data, they were assumed equal to those calculated for individuals aged 50-64 years. Societal direct costs were extrapolated by multiplying NSDUH estimates of the number of people with MDD by the direct cost estimates per patient for each of these 3 categories, stratified by age and gender.
Suicide-Related Costs Estimation
Suicide-related costs were estimated using the human capital method, incorporating the conservative assumption that household services had no human capital value.
5
,
12
The total number of suicides by age and gender cohort in 2005 and 2010 was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control.
27
On the basis of prior literature, we attributed 50% of suicides to MDD in our cost model.
28-30
In addition, the present value of lifetime earnings was estimated based on mortality rates and life expectancies from the National Vital Statistics Report
31
,
32
together with data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
33
,
34
To express future earnings in present value terms, we applied a 3% discount rate.
35
Workplace Costs Estimation
Workplace costs were estimated by assessing the value of missed days of work (absenteeism) and reduced productivity while at work (presenteeism) of individuals with MDD. By following the same approach as that described above for direct costs, workplace costs were estimated for the 3 categories: MDD costs, other depression costs, and nondepression costs. We estimated 3 categories of absenteeism costs: (1) injury/illness, (2) discretionary time off, and (3) disability. Absenteeism due to injury and illness was imputed for the employed and treated subgroup based on OptumHealth data, with outpatient visits on workdays counting as half a day missed and inpatient or emergency department visits on workdays counting as full days missed. The second absenteeism cost category was based on NSDUH, which reported the number of workdays missed “because the respondent didn’ t want to be there.” The added number of days missed by individuals with MDD compared with controls was attributed to the effects of MDD. Costs associated with these 2 categories were estimated for each patient based on the cumulative number of workdays missed (combining claims and NSDUH information) multiplied by that employee’s daily wage (from claims data). The third category of absenteeism costs, disability, was estimated directly from the claims data, which included duration and costs of short- and long-term disability for employed and treated beneficiaries. Absenteeism costs in the employed and not-treated group were assumed to be 48% of those incurred by the employed and treated group based on the workdays missed reported by both groups (from NSDUH). Presenteeism costs were assessed at 6.1 times the cost of absenteeism due to injury and illness, following previous MDD literature estimates.
7
(See
Supplementary eTable 6
for detailed calculation of ratios used to infer missing cost categories.) Finally, societal workplace costs were extrapolated using the approach described above for direct costs.
RESULTS
Prevalence, Employment, and Treatment Rates
Between 2005 and 2010, MDD prevalence rose from 13.8 million to 15.4 million adults (
Table 1A
). This growth was unevenly distributed by age, with the ≥ 50-year age group increasing fastest and the other age groups experiencing minor growth or slight decline (
Figure 1
). The overall change in prevalence was partly the result of the US adult population growing from 216 million to 228 million and partly due to an MDD prevalence rate increase from 6.4% to 6.8%.

Worsening economic conditions after the 2008 downturn took a particularly heavy toll, with 0.3 million fewer persons with MDD employed full-time, 0.3 million more employed part-time, and 1.6 million more not employed at all (ie, unemployed or not looking for work). Whereas the full-time employment rate was 8.7 percentage points lower for persons with than those without MDD in 2005, this gap widened to 10.3 percentage points in 2010 (
Table 1B
). Furthermore, full-time employment rates in the MDD group decreased 6.9 percentage points during this period, from 47.2% to 40.3%. This represented both a lower starting level and a steeper decline compared with the non-MDD group, which experienced a 5.3 percentage point reduction from 55.9% to 50.6%. Compared with the non-MDD group, the MDD group was also more frequently unemployed or not looking for work. Taken together, following the economic downturn, the “not-employed” rate increased by 6.2 percentage points among those with MDD compared with 3.8 percentage points within the non-MDD group.
There were 1.5 million more people treated for MDD in 2010 than in 2005, with the treatment rate increasing from 52.2% to 56.2% in that period (
Table 1C
). While the rate of treatment increased by 6.1 percentage points among the full-time employed, less pronounced rates of increase were observed among the part-time employed and the not-employed groups (1.2 and 0.8 percentage points, respectively).
MDD Costs: 2010 Versus 2005
The incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD was $173.2 billion in 2005 and $210.5 billion in 2010, an increase of 21.5% over this period (
Table 2A
). A large portion of this increase was attributable to higher direct medical and presenteeism costs. The composition of total incremental costs was stable over time, with 48%-50% attributable to workplace costs, 45%-47% to direct costs, and 5% to suicide-related costs. Of these total incremental costs, only 38% was attributable to MDD itself as opposed to comorbid conditions (
Table 2B
).

Direct costs.
Direct costs incurred by individuals with MDD totaled $77.5 billion in 2005, rising 27.5% to $98.9 billion in 2010 (
Table 2A
)
. The majority of the costs were for outpatient and inpatient medical services representing 15%-18% and 9%-10% of total costs in each study year, respectively. In addition, pharmacy costs accounted for 15% of the total in 2005 and 13% in 2010. Furthermore, direct costs attributable to individuals with MDD aged ≥ 50 years increased the fastest, the costs incurred by 18- to 25- and 26- to 34-year-old patients grew less rapidly, while those stemming from the 35- to 49-year age group remained flat (
Figure 1
). (See
Supplementary eTable 7
for additional results on incremental direct costs of individuals with MDD by employment status, treatment status, and age group in 2005 and 2010.)
For employed and treated patients, incremental direct costs of health care services were $5,707 per MDD patient in 2005, increasing by 5% in 2010 to $5,988 (
Table 3
). In both study years, the costs of services that were directly attributable to MDD accounted for only 40% of the incremental direct costs, with MDD drug costs declining over time as generics became more widely used.
36
An additional 10%-11% was due to depression other than MDD, with another 48%-51% stemming from other conditions (eg, hospitalization or physician office visits for mental illnesses, including anxiety, adjustment disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder, as well as a range of non-mental health services). This was mostly composed of various manifestations of pain, including disc and back disorders, abdominal pain, and chest pain, as well as sleep disorders, and migraines (
Table 3
).
37
,
38
(See
Supplementary eTable 8
for additional results on incremental cost per patient for non-mental health medical services in 2010.)

Suicide-related costs.
The adult suicide rate was 14.2 per 100,000 in 2005 and 15.9 per 100,000 in 2010,
27
with 50% of those suicides attributed to MDD. Suicide-related costs for the MDD group were estimated at $9.4 billion in 2005, 5% of the overall economic burden, rising by 2.7% to $9.7 billion in 2010 (
Table 2
). (See
Supplementary eTable 9
for the number of suicides and a detailed calculation of lifetime earnings lost due to MDD in 2005 and 2010.)
Workplace costs.
Presenteeism accounted for approximately 3 quarters of workplace costs and represented 37% of the overall economic burden of individuals with MDD (
Table 2
). In each study year, the equivalent of approximately 32 incremental workdays was lost due to presenteeism by the average individual with MDD (data not shown). Total presenteeism costs were estimated at $64.7 billion in 2005, and rose 21.5% over the ensuing 5 years to $78.7 billion in 2010. In contrast, incremental costs associated with absenteeism grew only 8.4% over the period 2005 to 2010, from $21.5 billion to $23.3 billion. This is composed of 21.5% growth in absenteeism due to injury/illness costs, 19.4% growth in discretionary absenteeism costs, and 24.6% decrease in disability costs. (See
Supplementary eTable 10
for detailed results on the incremental workplace costs of individuals with MDD in 2005 and 2010.)
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to estimate the economic burden of people with MDD; assess the cost share attributable to MDD versus comorbid conditions; understand the relative contributions of direct costs, suicide-related costs, and workplace costs; and analyze changes in these cost categories between 2005 and 2010. The emphasis on understanding the role of comorbid conditions dates back to our earlier cost-of-illness study,
5
which concluded that “future research will incorporate additional costs associated with depression sufferers, including the excess costs of their coexisting psychiatric and medical conditions.”
5(p1465)
The current study adds to our understanding of MDD as a source of significant economic burden. We estimated the incremental cost of people with MDD at $173.2 billion in 2005 and $210.5 billion in 2010, with 45%-47% attributable to direct costs, 5% to suicide-related costs, and 48%-50% to workplace costs. But MDD direct costs (including both medical and pharmaceutical services directly related to MDD treatment itself) accounted for only 12%-13% of this incremental burden of people with MDD, totaling $21.6 billion in 2005 and $27.7 billion in 2010. In fact, for every dollar spent on MDD direct costs in 2010, an additional $1.90 was spent on MDD-related indirect costs (ie, suicide-related, workplace), and another $4.70 was spent on direct and workplace comorbidity costs incurred by persons with MDD (
Figure 2
).
Individuals with MDD thereby experience a wide range of disease burdens, much of which is not usually categorized as directly related to the MDD treatment itself. The treatment rate of MDD remained relatively low in 2005 and 2010 (in the 50% range), likely contributing to the increasing burden of the disease. Thus, to the extent there is success in raising treatment rates, we would expect a shift from costs of people with the disease (ie, reduced cost of comorbid conditions) to costs associated with MDD (ie, increased treatment costs). The extent to which these competing forces would offset one another in dollar terms is a topic for further research. For example, whereas a condition like back pain may well be exacerbated by the presence of depression and therefore could potentially be alleviated by its successful treatment, the same is unlikely to be true for a condition like hypertension or cancer. Recent studies
39-41
suggest that collaborative care approaches that are mindful of these different pathways could allow for cost savings in the long term.

Understanding the source of cost changes between 2005 and 2010 reported in this study also merits further attention. The 27.5% increase in direct costs for people with MDD can be broken into 2 approximately equal-sized components: change in number of MDD cases, accounting for 12.8 percentage points of the increase in direct cost (of which 5.8 percentage points are due to growth in the adult US population, and 7.0 percentage points are attributable to an increase in the MDD prevalence rate) (
Table 1
); and change in cost per case, accounting for an additional 14.8 percentage points of the increase in direct costs.
Further research on the underlying drivers of these observed changes is warranted.
42
Indeed, the increase in the incremental direct cost per employed and treated patient with MDD reported in
Table 3
was more modest among the employed and treated patients with MDD, at 5%. This was most likely driven by the changing mix of employed patients with MDD in 2010 compared with 2005. That is, the worsening economy most likely led to a less severely depressed employed group by 2010, which would be an offsetting factor affecting the cost change for this group.
Through the business cycle, labor force attachment is far more volatile for people with MDD compared to those without. On the one hand, involuntary unemployment could spur more MDD, and on the other hand, the symptoms of illness could diminish employment prospects.
43
In economically robust times, persons with MDD tend to be highly employable, but when economic conditions worsen, they are disproportionately adversely affected, especially those aged 50 years and older. Furthermore, during economic downturns, the buffer of part-time work is not as widely available or accessed by the MDD group. Thus, the complex interplay of work status, MDD symptoms, and MDD treatment warrants continued study. Shining a bright light on the relative impact of these different contributors to direct cost changes, and understanding how they have moved historically, would offer insight into the available levers that could be brought to bear in most effectively managing resource utilization in this context over time.
There are several limitations of this study that are noteworthy. First, in the absence of a single data source to evaluate the economic burden of MDD, we relied on both original as well as literature-based estimates. Our ability to overlay literature-based estimates on our original analyses depends on the underlying consistency of these sources. However, it is comforting that many of these estimates are based on representative samples of persons with MDD drawn from the same or similar time periods and that the results do not appear to be highly sensitive to changes in these estimates. That is, we performed a sensitivity analysis with respect to the 3 parameters that are drawn from estimates in the literature (ie, the direct costs of MDD subjects who are not employed, the absenteeism costs of MDD subjects who are employed but not treated, and the presenteeism costs of MDD subjects who are employed) and found that increasing (or decreasing) these parameters by 10% results in an increase (or decrease) in the overall costs of MDD of 6% and in the costs of people with MDD of 5%. Second, presenteeism is estimated based on the relationship between presenteeism and absenteeism costs in 2002. To the extent this ratio changed through the business cycle, our estimate may not properly capture the workplace dynamic. Also, by 2010 many more jobs did not require a physical presence in the workplace, which could have changed the relationship between absenteeism and presenteeism relative to an earlier era. Third, our data do not allow costs for patients aged 65 years and older to be estimated directly, and so we have imputed these costs based on the cohort aged 50-64 years. In addition, our data do not allow for analysis of beneficiaries covered under certain types of managed care plans. This raises the possibility that our extrapolation does not fully reflect the experiences of these individuals. Finally, there are no severity markers in the data on which this study is based. Further research is needed on the sources of the economic burden of depression by severity of illness.
Taken together, the economic burden of adults with MDD is large and has grown over time. Several factors most likely contributed to the increase in costs between 2005 and 2010, including growth in the US population, increase in MDD prevalence, increase in treatment cost per individual with MDD, changes in employment and treatment rates, as well as changes in the composition and quality of MDD treatment services. Future research should focus on the relative importance of these different factors and analyze further the comorbidities associated with MDD that account for the largest portion of the total economic burden of the disease.

Abstract
Background
Noncigarette tobacco products are evolving rapidly, with increasing popularity in the United States.
Methods
We present prevalence estimates for 12 types of tobacco products, using data from 45,971 adult and youth participants (≥12 years of age) from Wave 1 (September 2013 through December 2014) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study, a large, nationally representative, longitudinal study of tobacco use and health in the United States. Participants were asked about their use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, traditional cigars, cigarillos, filtered cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah, snus pouches, other smokeless tobacco, dissolvable tobacco, bidis, and kreteks. Estimates of the prevalence of use for each product were determined according to use category (e.g., current use or use in the previous 30 days) and demographic subgroup, and the prevalence of multiple-product use was explored.
Results
More than a quarter (27.6%) of adults were current users of at least one type of tobacco product in 2013 and 2014, although the prevalence varied depending on use category. A total of 8.9% of youths had used a tobacco product in the previous 30 days; 1.6% of youths were daily users. Approximately 40% of tobacco users, adults and youths alike, used multiple tobacco products; cigarettes plus e-cigarettes was the most common combination. Young adults (18 to 24 years of age), male adults and youths, members of racial minorities, and members of sexual minorities generally had higher use of tobacco than their counterparts.
Conclusions
During this study, 28% of U.S. adults were current users of tobacco, and 9% of youths had used tobacco in the previous 30 days. Use of multiple products was common among tobacco users. These findings will serve as baseline data to examine between-person differences and within-person changes over time in the use of tobacco products. (Funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Food and Drug Administration.)
Smoking is responsible for more U.S. deaths annually than the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, use of alcohol and illegal drugs, motor vehicle accidents, murders, and suicides combined.
1
With recent data suggesting higher smoking-attributable mortality than previously estimated,
2
the medical community is urged to make tobacco control a high priority.
3
The prevalence of current use of cigarettes has declined during the past 50 years, from 42% of adults in 1965 to less than 20% in 2014,
4,5
but disparities in cigarette smoking across demographic subgroups (particularly according to race or ethnic group, educational attainment, and socioeconomic status) have widened during the past several decades,
5,6
and smoking prevalence remains exceptionally high among members of sexual minorities.
5,7,8
Furthermore, noncigarette tobacco products are rapidly evolving, and their effect on population-level health is unknown.
9–11
Use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), cigars, smokeless tobacco, and hookah (waterpipe) has risen sharply in the past decade,
12–15
and the use of two or more tobacco products has increased in recent years, especially among young adults.
16–19
The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 gave the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) broad regulatory authority over the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of regulated tobacco products to protect the health of the U.S. population.
20
The FDA Center for Tobacco Products uses a robust scientific evidence base to inform and assess the effect of its tobacco regulatory activities.
21
In 2011, the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study was established to generate longitudinal epidemiologic data on tobacco-use behavior and health in the U.S. population.
In contrast to other national studies that have been used for the surveillance of tobacco use,
22–27
the PATH Study uses a detailed assessment of tobacco-use behaviors, the inclusion of biomarkers, and a longitudinal design in a comprehensive effort to document tobacco use. Specifically, the design of the PATH Study will allow for examination of between-person differences and within-person changes over time in patterns of use of existing and emerging tobacco products, exposures and related biomarkers, risk perceptions, and health conditions potentially related to tobacco use.
28
An additional feature of the PATH Study is the use of pictures to assist respondents in answering questions about their awareness and use of noncigarette tobacco products.
29
Respondents in national surveys may not always clearly distinguish between types of tobacco products (e.g., filtered cigars vs. cigarettes, or snus pouches vs. other smokeless tobacco products), which could affect estimates of prevalence.
12,30
In this article, we present estimates of the prevalence of tobacco use among adults and youths, on the basis of Wave 1 (2013–2014) of the PATH Study, according to type of tobacco product and category of tobacco use. Three broad categories of tobacco-use behaviors were examined: the prevalence of use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, any type of cigar, traditional cigars, cigarillos, filtered cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah, smokeless tobacco (including and excluding snus pouches), snus pouches, dissolvable tobacco, bidis (small brown cigarettes wrapped in a leaf and typically tied on one or both ends with string; among youths), kreteks (clove cigarettes; among youths), and any tobacco product according to various categories of use; the prevalence of current use (among adults) or use in the previous 30 days (among youths) for each type of tobacco product according to demographic subgroup; and the prevalence of multiple-product use (i.e., use of two or more tobacco products) and single-product use.
Methods
Study Population
Wave 1 of the PATH Study included 45,971 adults and youths in the United States 12 years of age or older; data were collected from September 12, 2013, through December 15, 2014. This article reports national estimates from 32,320 adult participants (≥18 years of age) and 13,651 youth participants (12 to 17 years of age). Parent interviews were also conducted with one parent of 13,589 of the youth participants (99.5%). The parent interview collected information about the youth that was deemed to be more reliable when obtained from a parent (e.g., certain health information), as well as contextual information about the household and the parent’s own use of tobacco. Adult and youth data were collected with the use of an audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI), available in English and Spanish.
Address-based, area-probability sampling was used for recruitment; an in-person household screener selected youths and adults. Adult tobacco users, young adults (18 to 24 years of age), and black persons were oversampled relative to population proportions. Up to 2 youths per household were sampled unless a household included multiple births, in which case additional youths could be selected. Weighting procedures adjusted for oversampling and nonresponse. The weights were further adjusted so that the sums of the weights matched independent population totals for standard demographic groups; these totals were based on U.S. Census Bureau data. (For details on youth sampling and weighting procedures, see the
Supplementary Appendix
, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.) Combined with the use of a probability sample, the weighted data allow estimates produced by the PATH Study to be representative of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. The weighted response rate for the household screener was 54.0%. Among screened households, the overall weighted response rate was 74.0% for the adult interview and 78.4% for the youth interview. A nonresponse bias analysis for Wave 1 can be found at
https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR36231
.
The PATH Study implemented numerous procedures to protect respondents’ privacy and confidentiality, including obtaining written informed consent from adults and written assent from youths; requiring all staff to be certified in data security, confidentiality, and privacy issues and procedures; requiring staff to sign a pledge of confidentiality; storing and transmitting data with the use of advanced data encryption; and identifying survey data and biospecimens with the use of randomly assigned identification numbers and storing identifying information in separate, secure files. Further details regarding the PATH Study design and methods are reported by Hyland et al.
29
The study was conducted by Westat, a contract research organization, and approved by its institutional review board.
Measures
Types of Tobacco Products
Participants were asked a series of questions about each of the following 12 types of tobacco products: cigarettes, e-cigarettes, traditional cigars, cigarillos, filtered cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah, snus pouches, other smokeless tobacco (i.e., loose snus, moist snuff, dip, spit, or chewing tobacco), dissolvable tobacco, bidis (youths only), and kreteks (youths only). Participants were given a brief description and shown pictures of each type of product (except cigarettes) before being asked about the product. The questionnaires and pictures are available for downloading.
31
Categories of Tobacco Use
For each type of tobacco product, participants were asked a series of questions, including whether they had heard of the product (except cigarettes, for which universal awareness was assumed); whether they had ever used the product, even one or two puffs or one or two times; whether they had used the product during the previous 30 days; on how many of the previous 30 days they had used the product; and how much of each type of product they had used in their lifetimes. Adult participants were also asked whether they had ever used the product “fairly regularly” and whether they now use the product every day, some days, or not at all (nondaily users of hookah were also asked their frequency of use). Adults who had ever used a product but now use it “not at all” were asked how long it had been since they quit using it (responses were given in days, months, or years).
Various categories of tobacco use were assessed for each type of tobacco product. Current use indicates that the participant now smokes or uses the product every day or some days (for each tobacco product other than hookah; for hookah, current use indicates that the participant now uses the product every day, some days, usually weekly, or usually monthly). Current regular use indicates that the participant has ever smoked or used the product “fairly regularly” and now smokes or uses the product every day or some days (for each tobacco product other than cigarettes and hookah; for cigarettes, current regular use indicates that the participant has smoked ≥100 cigarettes in his or her lifetime and now smokes every day or some days; for hookah, current regular use indicates that the participant has ever used the product “fairly regularly” and now uses the product every day, some days, usually weekly, or usually monthly). Table S1 in the
Supplementary Appendix
presents additional categories of tobacco use that were assessed for each type of tobacco product. In addition, for each use category, use of any cigar was defined as use of at least one type of cigar (traditional cigars, cigarillos, or filtered cigars), use of smokeless tobacco including snus pouches was defined as use of either product, and use of any tobacco was defined as use of at least one of the 10 (adults) or 12 (youths) types of tobacco products. An exception to the definition of “any tobacco use” was current use of tobacco among adults, which was determined on the basis of current regular use in the case of cigarettes and current use in the case of every other tobacco product. Defining nonuse of any cigars, smokeless tobacco including snus pouches, and any tobacco required complete data on all types of the respective tobacco products assessed.
Multiple-Product and Single-Product Use
Among adults, multiple-product and single-product use was determined according to the “current regular use” definition for cigarettes and the “current use” definition for each other type of tobacco product. Among youths, multiple-product and single-product use was determined according to the “use in the previous 30 days” definition for each type of tobacco product. Complete data for all tobacco products were required to define multiple-product and single-product use. Single-product use was defined by the use of only one type of product (e.g., cigarettes only or e-cigarettes only), whereas multiple-product use was defined by the use of two or more types of products (e.g., both cigarettes and e-cigarettes). All combinations of multiple-product use were determined.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted with the use of Stata 12 software.
32
Prevalence estimates were weighted to represent the U.S. adult and youth populations. Variances were estimated with the method of balanced, repeated replications,
33
with Fay’s adjustment set to 0.3 to increase the stability of estimates.
34
The logit-transformation method was used to calculate confidence intervals. The tables show 95% confidence intervals for point estimates.
The prevalences of product awareness and use of each product type, use of any cigar, use of smokeless tobacco including snus pouches, and use of any tobacco were computed according to the use categories shown in Table S1 in the
Supplementary Appendix
as they pertained to adults and youths, stratified according to age group (12 to 14 years, 15 to 17 years, 18 to 24 years, or ≥25 years). Among adults, the prevalence of current regular use (cigarettes) or current use (other tobacco products) was also stratified according to sex, age, race or ethnic group, sexual orientation, educational attainment, total annual household income, and U.S. Census region. Among youths, the prevalences of ever use and use in the previous 30 days were also stratified according to sex, age, race or ethnic group, sexual orientation (asked of those ≥14 years of age), educational level, and U.S. Census region.
The prevalences of overall and product-specific single-product use and multiple-product use were determined in the entire adult study population, in the entire youth study population, among adult tobacco users, and among youth tobacco users. Among adult multiple-product users and separately among youth multiple-product users, all combinations of tobacco products used were determined, and each combination that accounted for at least 1% of multiple-product users is presented.
Results
Weighting
The weights were adjusted so that the sums of the weights for various demographic groups matched national population totals. Therefore, weighted distributions of the sample (
Table 1
, and Table S2 in the
Supplementary Appendix
) were very close to the population distributions.
Table 1
Demographic Characteristics of the Study Participants.
Tobacco Use According to Product Type and Use Category
Adults
Among adults, current use of cigarettes was most prevalent, followed by use of cigars, e-cigarettes, hookah, and smokeless tobacco (
Table 2
). The prevalence of use varied according to the use category, particularly for noncigarette tobacco products (Tables S3 through S6 in the
Supplementary Appendix
). For example, for cigars, the prevalence of current use was 7.8%, whereas the prevalence of current regular use was 3.2%. Similarly, for e-cigarettes, the prevalence of use in the previous 30 days was 6.7%, whereas the prevalence of current regular use was 2.4%. Similar variations were observed for hookah use: the prevalence of current use was 4.2%, whereas the prevalence of current regular use was 1.4%. (For more on current regular use, see Table S5 in the
Supplementary Appendix
.)
For most tobacco products and most use categories, the prevalence of use was higher among those 18 to 24 years of age than among those 25 years of age or older (
Table 2
, and Tables S3 through S6 in the
Supplementary Appendix
).
Table 2
Prevalence of Tobacco Use According to Product Type, Use Category, and Age Group.
Two thirds of adults had ever smoked cigarettes; 20.1% of adults were former regular users, and 25.3% were former nonregular users (Tables S3 and S6 in the
Supplementary Appendix
). The majority of adults had never used other types of tobacco products. Although the prevalence of former regular use was less than 5% for each type of noncigarette tobacco product, the prevalence of former nonregular use ranged from 0.4% (dissolvable tobacco) to 34.1% (cigars).
Youths
The majority of youths were aware of e-cigarettes, pipe tobacco, smokeless tobacco, any cigars, and hookah, whereas less than 10% were aware of dissolvable tobacco, kreteks, and bidis (Table S3 in the

). In general, youths 15 to 17 years of age were more likely to be aware of tobacco products than those 12 to 14 years of age. Overall, 21.8% of youths had ever used tobacco, 13.4% had ever used cigarettes, 10.7% had ever used e-cigarettes, 7.5% had ever used cigars (with use of cigarillos being most prevalent at 6.5%), 7.5% had ever used hookah, and 4.8% had ever used smokeless tobacco including snus pouches (
Table 2
). The prevalence of ever use of these products was higher among those 15 to 17 years of age than among those 12 to 14 years of age. The overall prevalence of tobacco use in the previous 30 days among youths was 8.9%, with prevalences of 4.6% for cigarette use, 3.1% for e-cigarette use, 2.5% for cigar use (with cigarillo use being most prevalent at 2.2%), 1.7% for hookah use, and 1.6% for use of smokeless tobacco including snus pouches. As with ever use, use in the previous 30 days was higher among those 15 to 17 years of age than among those 12 to 14 years of age.
Daily use was less than 2% for any tobacco product and followed a pattern that was similar to that for use in the previous 30 days. Cigarettes were the most common product used among daily users.
Tobacco Use According to Product Type and Demographic Subgroup
Adults
Men were more likely than women to use any tobacco product (34.8% vs. 20.8%) and to use each type of tobacco product other than dissolvable tobacco.
Use of any tobacco product also differed according to race or ethnic group, sexual orientation, educational level, income, and region, such that prevalence was higher among non-Hispanic American Indians or Alaska Natives, non-Hispanics of two or more races, and non-Hispanic blacks than among non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Asians, Native Hawaiians, or other Pacific Islanders; higher among those who identified as bisexual, gay, or lesbian than among those who identified as heterosexual; higher among those with less education and lower incomes than among their counterparts; and higher among those living in the South or Midwest than among those living in the Northeast or West. (For detailed data on current tobacco use among adults according to product type and demographic subgroup, see Tables S7 through S12 in the
Supplementary Appendix
.)
Youths
In general, the use of tobacco products according to demographic subgroup followed similar patterns for the categories of ever use and use in the previous 30 days. There was a consistent pattern of higher prevalence of tobacco use with increasing age and grade in school. In general, male youths were more likely than female youths to use tobacco, although for many products, differences in prevalence were small. Ever use of tobacco was highest among those who were non-Hispanic of two or more races and lowest among those who were non-Hispanic Asian.
Tobacco use was higher among youths who identified as bisexual, gay, or lesbian than among those who identified as heterosexual. In general, prevalence was similar across geographic regions. (For detailed data on ever use and use in the previous 30 days among youths according to product type and demographic subgroup, see Tables S13 through S22 in the
Supplementary Appendix
.)
Prevalence of Multiple-Product and Single-Product Use
Adults
Among adult tobacco users, the prevalence of multiple-product use was 37.8%, with 76.2% of multiple-product users using cigarettes and at least one other product (Table S23 in the
Supplementary Appendix
).
There were 331 different combinations of products used among adult multiple-product users, with the most common combination being cigarettes plus e-cigarettes (22.5%).
Figure 1
shows each combination of multiple-product use that accounted for at least 1% of adult multiple-product users; together these 20 combinations accounted for 66.2% of all adult multiple-product users. Among adults who used tobacco, 62.2% used one product, 22.5% used two products, and 15.3% used three or more products (not shown in figure). Among adult single-product users, more than 60% used cigarettes, and less than 10% used each of the other types of tobacco product (Table S23 in the
Supplementary Appendix
).
Figure 1
Most Common Combinations of Tobacco Products among Adult Multiple-Product Users.
Prevalences are based on data from 6238 adults who reported current use of two or more types of tobacco products (data were collected from September 12, 2013, through December 15, 2014). Percentages were weighted to the U.S. adult population. Current use was determined according to “current regular use” for cigarettes (the participant has smoked ≥100 cigarettes in his or her lifetime and currently smokes every day or some days) and according to “current use” for each other type of tobacco product. Complete tobacco-use data about every product were needed to determine multiple-product use.
Youths
Among youths who had used tobacco in the previous 30 days, the prevalence of multiple-product use was 43.0% (Table S24 in the
Supplementary Appendix
). Among youth multiple-product users, most used cigarettes (71.4%) and about half used e-cigarettes or cigarillos (53.7% and 46.0%, respectively).
Figure 2
shows the 10 combinations of multiple products for which robust prevalence estimates could be determined. Together, these 10 combinations accounted for 54.5% of multiple-product users. The most common combinations of products used were cigarettes plus e-cigarettes (accounting for 15.1% of multiple-product users) and cigarettes plus cigarillos (accounting for 10.1%). Among youths who used tobacco, 57.0% used one product, 23.7% used two products, and 19.3% used three or more products (not shown in figure). Among youth single-product users, approximately 40% used cigarettes, 24% used e-cigarettes, 15% used hookah, and less than 10% used cigarillos or smokeless tobacco (Table S24 in the
Supplementary Appendix
).
Figure 2
Most Common Combinations of Tobacco Products among Youth Multiple-Product Users.
Prevalences are based on data from 467 youths 12 to 17 years of age who reported having used two or more types of tobacco products in the previous 30 days (data were collected from September 12, 2013, through December 15, 2014). Percentages were weighted to the U.S. youth population. Complete tobacco-use data about every product were needed to determine multiple-product use.
Discussion
Initial (Wave 1) findings from the PATH Study, a nationally representative, longitudinal study of tobacco use and health in the United States, indicate that more than one quarter of adults 25 years of age or older and nearly 38% of young adults (18 to 24 years of age) were current users of a tobacco product in 2013 and 2014. A total of 15% of youths 15 to 17 years of age and nearly 3% of youths 12 to 14 years of age had used at least one type of tobacco product in the previous 30 days.
Although cigarette use was the most prevalent in each age group, approximately 40% of tobacco users used at least two types of products, with cigarettes plus e-cigarettes being the most common combination of products used by adults and by youths.
Several other findings advance the literature and warrant longitudinal assessment of this cohort. The PATH Study enabled the comparison of prevalence estimates for tobacco use across different tobacco products on the basis of varying categories of current and previous use. Findings showed marked differences in identification of tobacco users on the basis of differing categories assessed. For example, the prevalence of e-cigarette use among adults was cut approximately in half when the measure of current use was restricted to those who had ever used e-cigarettes “fairly regularly.” Similar findings emerged for hookah use and cigar use.
Findings also showed substantial differences in tobacco use according to demographic characteristics. Among adults, tobacco use was generally higher among younger adults, men, members of racial minorities, members of sexual minorities, those with lower educational attainment and lower household income, and those living in the South or Midwest than among their counterparts.
Among youths, the prevalences of ever use and use in the previous 30 days were higher among older youths, male youths, and members of sexual minorities than among their counterparts. Although these findings are generally consistent with those from other studies,
4,8,12,16,35–37
the PATH Study data extend these prevalence estimates for a wide array of tobacco products.
Although the PATH Study was designed as a cohort study rather than a national surveillance survey, it nonetheless produced baseline estimates of tobacco-use prevalence that are consistent with similarly defined estimates from national surveys. For instance, estimates of adult cigarette smoking and use of smokeless tobacco were similar in the PATH Study, the 2014 household-based National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH),
24
and the 2013–2014 telephone-based National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS)
4
(Table S25 in the
Supplementary Appendix
). Some differences in estimates of e-cigarette use and cigar use were observed across these studies (e.g., the prevalence of current use of e-cigarettes was 3.3% in NATS vs. 5.5% in the PATH Study, and the prevalence of cigar use in the previous 30 days was 4.8% in NSDUH vs. 7.2% in the PATH Study). However, these differences probably result from differences in the way questions were asked and some categories were defined. Cigars, for example, are a heterogeneous class of products: only the PATH Study used pictures of products to help respondents recognize cigar types. In addition, question-response options and lifetime thresholds of use of cigars and e-cigarettes differed across studies, which could further account for observed differences.
Estimates of tobacco-use prevalence among youths from the household-based PATH Study were generally lower than those from school-based national surveys of youths, such as the National Youth Tobacco Survey
27
and the Monitoring the Future study,
26
and were similar to estimates from the 2014 household-based NSDUH
24
(Table S26 in the
Supplementary Appendix
). These findings are consistent with previous literature citing mode of survey administration as a factor accounting for differences in estimates of tobacco-use prevalence in national surveys of youths.
38,39
Reasons for differences in estimates owing to survey mode are unclear. Surveys administered in a school-based environment may overestimate tobacco-use behaviors because of peer influences, whereas youths may underreport tobacco-use behaviors in a home-based survey out of fear that their parents will overhear answers or learn about them from the interviewer.
39,40
Implementation of the PATH Study ACASI instrumentation was intended to reduce this bias through the actual and perceived privacy afforded by having the youths self-administer the questionnaire silently using headphones and a touchscreen to hear or read the questions and record the answers.
Beyond differences in survey mode, the PATH Study youth sample did not include those 18 years of age, whereas the school-based surveys include 18-year-olds, and the data collection periods varied somewhat among surveys. Differences in the mode and timing of the surveys and the age structure of respondents probably contributed to differences in prevalence estimates and the rank-order of products between the PATH Study and the national surveys.
Although the findings reported here document the prevalence of tobacco use at the time of the first wave of the PATH Study, longitudinal data from future waves will help answer questions about transitions among multiple-product use, single-product use, nonuse of tobacco, and former tobacco use and, in particular, will help determine whether the direction of such transitions favors one type of product or another.
In conclusion, data from Wave 1 of the PATH Study indicate that more than a quarter of adults 18 years of age or older were current users of at least one type of tobacco product in 2013 and 2014 and nearly 1 in 10 youths 12 to 17 years of age used a tobacco product in the previous 30 days, with cigarette use being most prevalent. Multiple-product use was common among tobacco users, with cigarettes plus e-cigarettes being the most common combination of tobacco products used. These foundational estimates of prevalence will serve as a baseline for this longitudinal cohort to address critical research questions such as those related to changes in the use of tobacco products, among existing users as well as those not currently using tobacco products. These data will help inform tobacco regulatory and control efforts aimed at protecting the health of the U.S. population.

PPCS 2008
Summary
View help for Summary
The Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS) provides detailed information on the nature and characteristics of face-to-face contacts between police and the public, including the reason for and outcome of the contact. The PPCS interviews a nationally representative sample of United States residents aged 16 years or older as a supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey. To date, the PPCS has been conducted five times by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS):
The first survey -- described in the BJS publication Police Use of Force: Collection of National Data
(NCJ 165040) -- documented levels of contacts with police during 1996.
The second survey -- described in Contacts between Police and the Public: Findings from the
1999 National Survey (NCJ 184957) -- recorded police-citizen contacts in 1999. These data are
archived as POLICE-PUBLIC CONTACT SURVEY, 1999: [UNITED STATES] (ICPSR 3151).
The third survey -- described in Contacts between Police and the Public: Findings from the 2002
National Survey (NCJ 207845) -- covered interactions between police and the public in 2002. These data are archived as POLICE-PUBLIC CONTACT SURVEY, 2002: [UNITED STATES] (ICPSR 4273).
The fourth survey -- described in the BJS publication, Contacts between Police and the Public, 2005 (NCJ 215243) -- covered interactions between police and the public in 2005. These data are archived as POLICE-PUBLIC CONTACT SURVEY, 2005: [UNITED STATES] (ICPSR 20020).
The fifth survey -- described in the BJS publication, Contacts between Police and the Public, 2008 (NCJ 234599) -- covered interactions between police and the public in 2008. These data are archived as POLICE-PUBLIC CONTACT SURVEY, 2008 (ICPSR 32022).

Methodology
Study Design
View help for Study Design
The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is an annual survey that collects data on crime against persons aged
12 years or older from a nationally representative, stratified, multistage cluster sample of United States households. Since 1999, the
Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS) has been administered every 3 years as a supplemental survey to all persons aged 16 years or older within households sampled for the NCVS.
The United States Census Bureau fielded the 2008 PPCS questionnaire, processed the survey data, and provided estimation specifications. The 2008 PPCS was pretested in the spring of 2008 and conducted between July 1, 2008, and December 31, 2008. Respondents were asked about their contacts with police during the past 12 months. For instance, persons interviewed in July 2008 were asked about contacts that occurred between August 2007 and July 2008. Those interviewed in August 2008 were asked about contacts between September 2007 and August 2008.
In 2008 the PPCS interviewed 57,978 of the 72,566 eligible individuals in the NCVS sample. A total of 14,588 nonrespondents who were excluded from the 2008 PPCS as non-interviews or as proxy interviews. Non-interviews (12,803) included respondents not available for the interview, those who refused to participate, and non-English speaking respondents. (Unlike the NCVS interviews, PPCS interviews are conducted only in English.) The remaining 1,785 were proxy interviews representing household members who were unable to participate for physical, mental, or other reasons. After adjustment for nonresponse, the sample cases in 2008 were weighted to produce a national population estimate of 236,511,832 persons aged 16 years or older.

Project Description
Summary
View help for Summary
This data collection presents base year through fourth
follow-up data for the National Education Longitudinal Study (see
NATIONAL EDUCATION LONGITUDINAL STUDY, 1988 [ICPSR 9389], FIRST
FOLLOW-UP, 1990 [ICPSR 9859], SECOND FOLLOW-UP, 1992 [ICPSR 6448]),
and THIRD FOLLOW-UP, 1994 [ICPSR 6961]. In addition, these data
sustain continuing trend comparisons with NATIONAL LONGITUDINAL STUDY
OF THE CLASS OF 1972 (ICPSR 8085) and HIGH SCHOOL AND BEYOND, 1980
(ICPSR 7896, 8297, 8443, 8896). NELS:88/2000 collected information on
this cohort's accomplishments 12 years after the eighth-grade baseline
survey. The 2000 data were collected at a key stage of life
transitions for the eighth-grade class of 1988 since most had been out
of high school for nearly eight years and many had already completed
postsecondary education, started or even changed careers, and started
families. Part 1, Student-Level Data, includes universe variables,
base-year, first and second follow-up student components, school
variables at the student level, second and third follow-up early
graduate supplement and student-level transcript variables, first,
second, and third follow-up dropout components, base-year and second
follow-up parent components, and third and fourth follow-up
questionnaires and derived variables. Part 2, Postsecondary Education
Attendance Data, provides information for third and fourth follow-up
respondents on attendance at postsecondary institutions. Part 3,
Postsecondary Institution Data, supplies information about
institutions applied to or attended by fourth follow-up respondents
regarding sector, tuition/fee deciles, and enrollment. Part 4,
Postsecondary 1994 Education Attendance Data, provides information for
third follow-up respondents on attendance at postsecondary
institutions, including enrollment dates and major fields of study.

Methodology
Sample
View help for Sample
The base-year survey in 1988 was a clustered, stratified
national probability sample of 1,052 public and private eighth-grade
schools with almost 25,000 students across the United States
participating. For the first follow-up in 1990, 21,000 students were
sampled and an additional parent survey was added. The second
follow-up in 1992 also included a school records component. In each
survey, multiple respondent populations were surveyed: students
(including dropouts), their teachers, their parents, and their school
administrators. In the 1990 and 1992 follow-up studies, a freshened
sample was included to achieve a representative sample of the
respective age group in the nation. The fourth follow-up study in 2000
began with a sample of 15,237 individuals, subsampled from the
sampling frame of 15,964 individuals used for the third follow-up
study in 1994, thus removing 647 third follow-up nonrespondents from
the frame. At the end of the data collection for the study, a second
subsample of study nonrespondents was drawn to limit bias resulting
from interview nonrespondents. The subsample included 386 fourth
follow-up nonrespondents selected from American Indian and Alaskan
Native, Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and dropout strata.

Abstract
Background:
CDC has not previously calculated disease rates for men who have sex with men (MSM) because there is no single comprehensive source of data on population size. To inform prevention planning, CDC developed a national population size estimate for MSM to calculate disease metrics for HIV and syphilis.
Methods:
We conducted a systematic literature search and identified seven surveys that provided data on same-sex behavior in nationally representative samples. Data were pooled by three recall periods and combined using meta-analytic procedures. We applied the proportion of men reporting same-sex behavior in the past 5 years to U.S. census data to produce a population size estimate. We then calculated three disease metrics using CDC HIV and STD surveillance data and rate ratios comparing MSM to other men and to women.
Results:
Estimates of the proportion of men who engaged in same-sex behavior differed by recall period: past year = 2.9% (95%CI, 2.6–3.2); past five years = 3.9% (3.5–4.4); ever = 6.9% (5.1–8.6). Rates on all 3 disease metrics were much higher among MSM than among either other men or women (38 to 109 times as high).
Conclusions:
Estimating the population size for MSM allowed us to calculate rates for disease metrics and to develop rate ratios showing dramatically higher rates among MSM than among other men or women. These data greatly improve our understanding of the disproportionate impact of these diseases among MSM in the U.S. and help with prevention planning.

INTRODUCTION
Since the beginning of the HIV epidemic in the United States, men have accounted for the largest proportion of cases, and the large majority of those men have been gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (collectively referred to here as MSM). MSM accounted for 53% of estimated new HIV infections in the United States in 2006 and MSM who also injected drugs accounted for an additional 4% of estimated new infections [
1
]. Moreover, MSM comprise the only risk group with increasing numbers of new HIV infections [
1
]. Similarly, the number of cases of primary and secondary syphilis has grown rapidly among men in the past decade, and the majority of cases have been among MSM [
2
].
The disparity in number of HIV and syphilis cases among MSM compared to their population size has been difficult to quantify. While U.S. census data currently allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to calculate disease rates by age, sex at birth, and racial/ethnic groups [
2
,
3
], there are no census data for the number of MSM in the United States. Estimation of a population size for MSM will allow for the calculation of disease rates among MSM to quantify the disparate impact of various diseases among MSM and to better guide allocation of prevention resources. The estimation of population size for MSM will also allow researchers to compare rates across regions (both within and outside the U.S.) and examine trends over time (since population sizes can change over time).
Research by Kinsey and his colleagues [
4
] led to the notion that approximately 10% of U.S. men are gay or bisexual. Later reviews lowered this estimate by approximately half [
5
]. In 1990, the U.S. census added questions about same-sex household partners, but these data cannot lead to a national estimate because people who are not partnered were uncounted [
6
]. Lieb and his colleagues [
7
] summarized a wide variety of methods that have been used to estimate the size of the MSM population in specific cities, states, or for the whole United States. In their work, Lieb and his colleagues [
7
] provided statewide estimates ranging from 3.3% (North Dakota) to 13.2% (District of Columbia) with an overall estimate that MSM were 6.4% of the male population (7.1 million men). These estimates were derived using data from two national surveys that assessed whether men reported ever engaging in same-sex behavior [
8
,
9
]. Lieb and colleagues [
10
] used their MSM population estimates to show that rates of HIV for MSM in 17 southern states were 36 times as high compared to other men in the south, with rates among MSM highest for African Americans in all states and lowest among white MSM in all but one state.
While there have been a variety of methods and estimates of the national population size of MSM, CDC was interested in developing a single estimate to use in interpreting HIV and sexually transmitted diseases (STD) surveillance data. Combining the findings from the existing literature into one population size estimate can be challenging because 1) sampling frames and recall periods differ, 2) measurements focus on different domains such as sexual behavior, sexual identity, sexual attraction, or having a relationship with a man, and 3) stigma may affect reporting rates on sensitive topics such as same-sex behaviors or identity based on whether the survey was self administered or involved speaking to an interviewer [
11
]. However, a quantitative synthesis (i.e., meta-analysis) of relevant and appropriate surveys would allow CDC to develop a national estimate of MSM population size to use to better understand the burden of HIV and STDs in the United States.
The goals of this paper are to 1) meta-analyze population-based surveys to estimate the proportion of men in the United States who are MSM and estimate proportion of MSM by race/ethnicity and age if possible; 2) use these estimates to calculate disease metrics for MSM using national surveillance data for HIV and for primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis; and 3) calculate rate ratios to directly compare rates for MSM to rates in other men and women and to compare rates among MSM by race/ethnicity and age. The National HIV/AIDS Strategy [
12
] highlights MSM as a high priority population that must be the focus of prevention resources to reduce HIV infections in the United States and adds urgency to our desire to better describe and understand the disproportionate impact of HIV on MSM. An estimate of MSM population size and disease rates can help to guide resource allocation and programmatic efforts and establish benchmarks for monitoring progress.
METHODS
Meta-Analysis
Study Selection
We developed a search strategy to identify relevant reports published or in press between 1993 and 2008. The focus on more recent years was due to changes in social norms and acceptance of homosexual behavior that were expected to affect reporting of same-sex behavior. A CDC librarian conducted systematic searches of five electronic databases (Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Sociological Abstracts, and Cochrane) by cross-referencing multiple search terms (i.e., keywords and each database’s index terms) in three domains: measurement descriptors (measurement, prevalence, data collection, assessment, epidemiologic measures, population), male-male sexual behavior (homosexuality, gay, male-to-male sexual contact, anal sex, men who have sex with men) and geography (limited to samples from some or all of the U.S.). We specifically kept the search terms broad in order to not miss any relevant references that might provide either data or different methods for estimating population size for MSM. These initial searches yielded 2862 references (see Fig.
1
).

Survey Selection Process for Meta-Analysis.
Each abstract was screened by two trained reviewers based on explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies were initially included if they reported prevalence of same-sex sexual behavior (sex with a man; male sex partners), sexual identity/orientation, or sexual attraction. To avoid overestimating the MSM population size, we excluded studies that recruited populations likely to have a high proportion of MSM (e.g., HIV-infected persons, STD clinics, homeless youth) and studies that specifically recruited MSM samples. Conference abstracts or dissertations were screened but not included, as they provided too few details for calculating the estimate.
The initial review of abstracts eliminated 2810 references and identified 52 potentially relevant references representing 40 unique studies with independent data sets for full-report coding. We then excluded school-based samples (including university students) that may have over or underestimated MSM population size and those that only measured sexual orientation or attraction but did not include a same-sex behavioral measure because our focus was on estimating the proportion of men engaging in same-sex behaviors that put them at risk for sexual acquisition of HIV and other STDs. We included only national, probability-based surveys. If multiple publications reported data from the same study, findings from the most comprehensive report were used to avoid overlap. These criteria were applied to the 40 studies and 7 met our criteria and were included in our meta-analyses (see Table
1
). These surveys included questions on gender of sex partners (e.g., “Have your sex partners in the last 12 months been: exclusively male, exclusively female, or both male and female” for which we included “exclusively male” and “both male and female” in the population estimate; or “What have you done sexually with a man since you reached puberty” with responses options including oral and anal sex). To examine the extent to which the proportion of men reporting same-sex behavior varied by behavioral recall period, we calculated multiple population estimates if a study provided more than one relevant behavioral recall period. For example, if a study reported data for the past year and past five years, we calculated two population estimates for this study and examined these data separately.

Sex of sex partner data were available for 8,900 (86.5%) of 10,289 men in these 39 states during 2008.
Obtaining Data for Meta-Analysis
For each study we obtained the proportion of men who reported same-sex behaviors or partners and its variance (standard error) using the data presented in the publications or by analyzing the original survey data. We estimated the proportion of MSM for each of 3 recall periods most commonly used in the surveys: ever (i.e., lifetime), past 5 years, and past year. The population-level proportion estimates and variances were taken directly from publications for the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) [
9
], Project HOPE International Survey of AIDS-Risk Behaviors (Project HOPE) [
13
], the National STD and Behavior Measurement Experiment (NSBME) [
14
], and the National Health and Social Life Survey (NHSLS) (for lifetime data only) [
8
]. For the General Social Survey (GSS) [
15
], NHANES (1999-2008) [
16
], the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) [
17
], and the NHSLS (for past year and past 5 year data only) [
18
], we analyzed or asked the original researchers to analyze the original survey data using SUDAAN [
19
] to take the sample design of each survey into account in estimating the proportion of MSM and variance.
We applied a meta-analytic method that has recently been extended to survey data [
20
]. For each specific recall period, we first multiplied each prevalence estimate by a weight inversely proportional to its variance, summed the weighted prevalence estimates across studies, and then divided by the sum of the weights. Because the surveys included in our analysis used questions that were worded differently, employed different sampling designs to reach their target populations, and were conducted over a period of several years, we used Rao’s method [
20
] to account for the variability of estimates by adding a corresponding between-studies variance term before deriving the overall prevalence estimate. We examined the heterogeneity of prevalence estimates across surveys using the Q statistic as described in Rao [
20
] and Higgins’ I
2
index [
21
]. Values of the I
2
index around 25, 50, and 75 typically correspond to low, medium, and high heterogeneity, respectively. The aggregated findings for the overall proportion of MSM were based on random-effects models, which provide a more conservative estimate of variance and generate more accurate inferences about a population of studies beyond those included in this review.
For calculating rates, we chose to use the overall past-5-year estimate as a conservative, mid-range estimate of population size of MSM. The past year estimate is the smallest, and it may exclude MSM who have not been sexually active recently. The “ever” estimate is the largest and may include some men who only had incidental same-sex contact many years ago or once. We considered the past-5-year estimate the best available recall period for MSM behavior to use to estimate the proportion of MSM in the total population (of men and overall) because we wanted to compare calculated disease rates for MSM to those often reported in CDC surveillance data based on US census categories.
We planned to conduct a second set of meta-analyses to estimate the MSM prevalence by racial/ethnic group and by age categories because we assumed that there might be differences by race or age. Four of the 7 eligible surveys had some data by race/ethnicity and age (NSFG, NHANES, NHSDA, and NHSLS). Three of these surveys had a recall period of “ever” and one had a recall period of past year. However, due to the small number of surveys with race- and age-specific data and small samples sizes of MSM when stratified by race/ethnicity, proportion estimates calculated in preliminary analyses were very imprecise with large associated confidence intervals (data not shown). It also would have been necessary to adjust the data to be parallel with the overall past-5-year estimate. Because of our inability to estimate race-specific population sizes of MSM, we applied the overall past-5-year estimate of the proportion of MSM to the race/ethnicity and age-specific distributions from U.S. census data. Categories included three mutually exclusive racial/ethnic groups (black/African American [non-Hispanic], Hispanic/Latino, and white [non-Hispanic]) and 5 age groups (13-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, and >55 years).
All meta-analytic calculations per Rao’s method were carried out in Microsoft Excel® 2007 spreadsheets and verified in SAS® Version 9.2. The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (version 2) [
22
] which incorporates assumptions appropriate for synthesizing results from observational studies and clinical trials, was used to verify results and look for comparable patterns in the data.
Disease Rates and Rate Ratios
HIV and AIDS Data
We analyzed data on adults and adolescents (ages 13 or older at diagnosis) with a diagnosis of HIV infection (regardless of stage of disease) in 2008 and reported to CDC through June 2009. Cases of HIV infection were reported from 37 states with confidential, name-based reporting since at least January 2005 [
3
]. Estimated diagnoses of HIV infection are based on numbers of diagnoses in a given year adjusted for delays in reporting of cases and for missing risk factor information, but not for incomplete reporting [
3
,
23
]. We estimated the number of persons living with a diagnosis of HIV for those persons diagnosed with HIV (regardless of stage of disease at diagnosis) and include persons diagnosed through 2007 and living at the end of 2007 [
3
]. The estimated numbers of persons living with HIV are based on diagnoses and deaths which were adjusted for delays in reporting of cases and of deaths and for missing risk factor information [
3
,
23
].
Primary and Secondary Syphilis Data
Reports of P&S syphilis represent recently acquired infection, and therefore represent valid indicators of incidence [
24
]. Data from interviews with patients with P&S syphilis are reported by health departments to CDC
via
the National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance (NETSS). We reviewed NETSS data from states where sex of sex partner (male, female, or both) was reported for 70% or more of male cases of primary and secondary syphilis 13 years of age and older during 2008. The 70% threshold represented the best balance between including male cases of P&S syphilis while gathering the most complete epidemiologic data for those cases. For states meeting this threshold of reporting, we reviewed information on sex, sex of sex partner, age, race and ethnicity. Thirty-nine states and Washington, D.C. met inclusion criteria, yielding 12,110 reports of P&S syphilis that accounted for 89.7% of all reported P&S syphilis in the U.S. during 2008.
U.S. Census Data and Numbers of MSM, Other Men, and Women
To match ages used in HIV and syphilis surveillance data, we used U.S. census data to calculate numbers of men and women ages 13 and older [

]. For men, we then divided the population into the number of MSM and number of other men. To do this, we calculated number of MSM by multiplying our newly derived past-5-year estimate of the proportion of MSM among men (and its 95% confidence interval) by the 2008 population estimate of men aged 13 and older. The number of MSM was then subtracted from the total of all men aged 13 and older to compute the population size of other men.
Calculating Rates and Rate Ratios
We used the estimated number of MSM and other men and the U.S. census count for women as denominators to calculate rates per 100,000 persons for 3 disease metrics (estimated diagnoses of HIV infection, estimated number of people living with a diagnosis of HIV infection, cases of primary or secondary syphilis). Rates were calculated by dividing the estimated number of cases in a population group by the number of people in that population group. Rates were first calculated for MSM, other men, and women. Among MSM, rates were further calculated for race/ethnicity and age groups. For all groups and subgroups except for women, estimated rates are reported with upper and lower confidence intervals to reflect the uncertainty related to the calculation of the proportion of MSM in the population. As the estimate of the number of MSM increased, the estimate of the number of other men decreased, meaning that rates changed inversely for MSM and for other men.
Finally, we calculated rate ratios (and confidence intervals where relevant) to directly compare rates between different groups. First, we calculated the rate ratios between MSM and other men and between MSM and women by dividing the rate for MSM by the rate for other men and for women. Next we calculated rate ratios within MSM by race/ethnicity and age. For race/ethnicity, we used white MSM as the reference group and compared their rates with the rates for black/African American MSM and Hispanic/ Latino MSM. For age, we used the youngest age group of MSM as the reference and compared their rates to the 4 older age groups of MSM. There are no confidence intervals for rate ratios within MSM for race/ethnicity or age because the proportion of men in each subgroup does not change as the proportion of MSM in the population changes.
RESULTS
Proportion of the Population Estimated to be MSM
Table
2
shows the estimated proportion of males who were MSM, by recall period, for each of the relevant population-based surveys and the combined estimates for each recall period. The aggregated estimate from the 4 surveys with a “past 5 year” recall period is 3.9% (95% CI = 3.5%, 4.4%). This estimate falls between the combined estimate from the 6 surveys with a “past year” recall period (2.9%, 95% CI = 2.6%, 3.2%) and the combined estimate from the 4 surveys with an “ever” recall period (6.9%, 95% CI = 5.1%, 8.6%). Q statistics and I
2
indicate heterogeneity of results across surveys with an “ever” recall period (Q
3
= 22.2, P <.01, I
2
= 86.5). However, sensitivity tests did not reveal any individual survey that exerted disproportionate influence on the overall estimate. The heterogeneity tests for surveys with a “past 5 years” recall period (Q
3
= 3.1, P =.38, I
2
= 2.3) and with a “past year” recall period (Q
5
= 5.3, P =.38, I
2
= 5.9) were not significant indicating lack of heterogeneity.
Table
3
shows the population size of men aged 13 and older and the number of MSM and other men using the 3.9% proportion estimate (and 95% confidence interval). We estimate that in 2008, 4,791,262 men in the U.S. were MSM, with a range from 4,299,850 to 5,405,526.
Disease Rates and Rate Ratios
Rates of estimated diagnoses of HIV infection, rates of people living with HIV, and rates of P&S syphilis were higher among MSM than among other men or women (Tables
4
-
6
). The rate ratios indicate disparities between MSM and other men and MSM and women. Comparing MSM to other men, the estimated rate of diagnoses of HIV infection in 2008 was 59 to 75 times as high (Table
4
), the estimated rate of MSM living with a diagnosis of HIV infection was 38 to 48 times as high (Table
5
), and the P&S syphilis diagnosis rate was 63 to 79 times as high (Table
6
). Rate ratios comparing MSM and women were similar to those comparing MSM and other men for the HIV metrics (Tables
4
-
5
). For P&S syphilis, the rate ratio was higher for MSM compared to women than for MSM compared to other men (Table
6
).
Among MSM, black/African Americans had the highest disease rates while whites had the lowest rates, regardless of epidemiologic measure. By age group, the highest estimated rate of diagnoses of HIV infection occurred among MSM aged 25 to 44. Estimated rates of MSM living with a diagnosis of HIV infection were highest among men aged 35 to 54. The estimated rate of P&S syphilis among MSM was highest among men aged 25 to 44.
Rate ratios indicate substantial disparities between MSM by racial/ethnic groups for all disease metrics. Across the 3 disease metrics, rates for black/African American MSM were 3.8 to 6 times as high as those for white MSM. Rates for Hispanic/Latino MSM were 1.8 to 2.7 times as high as those for white MSM (Tables
4
-
6
).
DISCUSSION
Using meta-analysis with behavioral data from population-based surveys, we found that MSM comprised 3.9% (3.5% - 4.4%) of the U.S. adult male population. This translates into approximately 2.0% of the overall population or 4,791,262 MSM in the United States (95%CI = 4,299,850 to 5,405,526) in 2008. It is important to have these population size estimates to calculate disease rates and other metrics and to compare disease burden on a standard scale. Compared to other men and women, for the two HIV disease metrics, MSM rates were 38 to 75 times as high, and for P&S syphilis, rates were 63 to 109 as high. Data in the U.S. show that MSM make up approximately half of all persons living with HIV infection (whether diagnosed or undiagnosed) [
26
] and that in 2009, MSM accounted for 61% of new infections [
27
]. However, the rates calculated here indicate that this disease burden, relative to the size of the MSM population, is of tremendous magnitude. The disparity in rates for MSM compared to other men and women exceeds disparities between race/ethnicity groups reported in HIV surveillance data [
3
] or between MSM race/ethnicity groups reported here. Quantifying these disparities can help to better focus the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and allocate resources on the most disproportionately affected groups [
12
]. Our data also quantify well known disparities among MSM, showing that African American men are the most affected group within the already disproportionately affected MSM group. Not surprisingly, our estimates for racial/ethnic disparities between MSM are very similar to those calculated by Lieb and colleagues [
7
] because these relative disparities between groups of MSM are not affected by using different estimates of MSM population size.
The estimated proportion of MSM that we calculated for 3 different recall periods can be used by others to calculate rates for other diseases or measures (e.g., past year estimate for HIV incidence rate). Using meta-analysis to calculate an estimate gives us a more robust and stable proportion of MSM than selecting a population size estimate from one particular study and is especially useful when applying these estimates to a variety of surveillance data.
It is important to reiterate that our estimates are based on male-male sexual behavior. We did not use data on sexual identity or attraction, and thus, our estimate is not analogous to the number of self-identified gay and bisexual men in the United States. Because we focused on disease rates, we were more focused on behavior that puts people at risk for infection when we estimated our population size.
Despite the strengths of our methods, a few limitations regarding these data should be noted. First, a meta-analysis rests on the strengths of the underlying studies — and while the study designs are quite robust in the 7 national surveys that met our inclusion criteria, they are hampered by small sample sizes of MSM. Because MSM are a small proportion of the population, obtaining a large enough overall sample so that there are adequate numbers of MSM is difficult in such studies without huge samples sizes. This issue is compounded when we are interested in understanding more about subgroups of MSM such as racial/ethnic or age groups. MSM are seldom over-sampled in population-based surveys to improve representativeness and representation. In addition, under-reporting of same-sex behavior due to perceived stigma could result in an underestimate of population size; however, this bias should be mitigated to some extent by the private self-report format for sexual behavior used in all the surveys included in the meta-analysis. Given the possible factors that affected the data in the original studies, it is important to consider our analysis, which is essentially a secondary analysis, in this context. Our rates should always be interpreted in the context of the confidence intervals we presented and the range of likely values of the proportion of MSM in the population, as well as a range of values for disease rates and rate ratios. Another caution is that the age ranges of MSM reported in the surveys did not match the age ranges of men in the two surveillance systems reported here or in U.S. census data. When selecting age ranges from census data, we chose to match them to the age ranges reported in the surveillance data which was easier because of the diversity of ages of men in the surveys. In our analyses, we did not account for these age-range differences between the surveys and our other data. We also did not examine trends in age distribution over time in the population which also could potentially affect our results. Finally, our choice to use the estimate based on behavioral data from “past 5 years” does not correspond to the HIV surveillance definition of MSM, which is same-sex behavior since 1977. However, as noted previously, we judged this population estimate to be more robust than measures for the other two time periods. Because we have presented our other two estimates here, other researchers or program staff can use these higher or lower estimates to determine rates or rate ratios if those estimates better fit their needs.
In sum, the meta-analysis results presented here represent one method for making population size estimates for MSM. Future estimates may be improved or refined by considering methods other than meta-analysis [
28
], including data from younger or more recent cohorts, and recruiting larger samples from which to calculate age- and race/ethnicity-specific estimates. Although national estimates are useful for monitoring the epidemic on a broad scale, local jurisdictions would benefit from using appropriate methods to develop local estimates of MSM population size to monitor their local epidemics [
28
]. The population estimates of the number of MSM (as well as rates and ratios) can be updated annually based on U.S. census population figures, although they are unlikely to change dramatically from year to year. In contrast, the meta-analysis estimate of the population proportion of MSM is not expected to be updated frequently, as meta-analyses are best updated when a significant amount of new data are available and national samples focused on MSM behavior are limited in number. Trends from population-based surveys will be monitored as part of CDC’s program of HIV behavioral surveillance [
29
] and the MSM population size estimate meta-analysis can be updated as new data accumulate.
While these rates will help our public health efforts, going forward, CDC will report them separately from their surveillance reports. To date, disease rate information for population subgroups assessed by the U.S. census, such as men and women and racial and ethnic groups, has been reported in HIV and STD surveillance reports. Because the MSM population estimate was derived from sources other than direct U.S. census population figures, disease rates for MSM and for persons in other transmission categories will be reported separately from the annual HIV Surveillance Report [
3
] and STD Surveillance Report [
2
]. Regular reporting of these data will help CDC and local areas monitor the progress of disease prevention.
Because meta-analysis quantitatively combines estimates from multiple studies, it provides a strong basis for a national estimate of the proportion of MSM in the U.S. Our analyses are complementary to other recent publications on this topic which provide guidance so that local areas or states can develop their own estimate of the size of local MSM populations to guide program planning [
28
]. When taken together, these local or state estimates and our national estimate of population size can be used to provide a broader understanding of the HIV epidemic and the surge in syphilis among those most at risk for transmission and acquisition of these infectious diseases. The MSM meta-analysis estimate and the disease rate calculations provide important tools for monitoring and characterizing the HIV and syphilis epidemics in the United States and they can be helpful in implementing and monitoring the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and syphilis elimination efforts. These data — like all surveillance data — will establish their utility as they are translated into action for public health purposes such as resource allocation, program design, and evaluation of policies and programs. Resources must be directed to the populations at highest risk and to strategies that are cost-effective. The best available data must be used to guide decision-making at the national, state, and local levels [
30
]. The MSM population size estimate and resulting rates and rate ratios are important additions to the data we use to make these critical decisions.

Abstract
In 2010, ICPSR began a long process of recovering data from Gordon Streib’s Cornell Study of Occupational Retirement (CSOR). Because the unique data fill a gap in our understanding of US retirement history, we determined that an extensive data recovery project was warranted. This paper describes the scope of the data collection and the steps in ICPSR’s recovery process. Though the data recovery was ultimately successful, this paper documents the amount of time invested and costs associated with this kind of recovery work. It also highlights the value of these data for future research in understanding gender and retirement in a historic context. In addition to the resulting publicly available data arising from this project, extensive paper medical records are housed at ICPSR for on-site analysis or for a future digitization project. These data would provide unique health information on older women and men traced over a period of time in the 1950s and represents future work for ICPSR to undertake.

Description
As the host institution for the DDI Alliance, the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) has invested heavily in DDI since the 1990s. One example of the investment may be seen in the ICPSR Social Science Variables Database, which uses structured DDI metadata to enable ICPSR users to examine and compare variables and questions across studies or series. The majority of ICPSR's data collections currently are described using DDI Codebook (DDI 2.5), which is intended primarily to document simple survey data. ICPSR is now taking steps to document selected collections using DDI-Lifecycle (DDI 3), which is especially useful for helping data users understand the relationships among waves of longitudinal data. This presentation, given at the North American Data Documentation Initiative User Conference (NADDI) 2018 on April 6, 2018 in Washington, D.C., highlighted the process of moving to DDI-Lifecycle for one pilot collection, including benefits and lessons learned.

Project Description
Summary
View help for Summary
This study contains data on the working conditions of
1,455 workers aged 16 and older who were working for pay for 20 or
more hours per week in the United States in the period 1973-1977.
This survey is a panel study version of the cross-section study,
QUALITY OF EMPLOYMENT SURVEY, 1977: CROSS-SECTION (ICPSR 7689).
The surveys were undertaken by the investigators to provide an
overview of working conditions in the American labor force. The
aims of these surveys and many of the questions that were asked
were comparable to those of the related collections, SURVEY OF WORKING
CONDITIONS, 1969-1970 (ICPSR 3507), and QUALITY OF EMPLOYMENT SURVEY,
1972-1973 (ICPSR 3510). The major measures used in each of the four
surveys were the frequency and severity of labor standards problems,
the quality of employment indicators that were shown to be predictors
of job satisfaction, the job satisfaction indices themselves, and the
ratings of important job facets. Respondents were asked questions about
many facets of their job situations and other areas of their lives that
might be affected by their jobs in order to assess the impact of work
on them. Questions included job tension, security, physical health, job
satisfaction, and financial well-being. A series of questions regarding
job expectations was also asked. Additional questions probed respondents'
feelings about their overall contentment with their jobs and with life
in general. Other variables probed respondents' feelings about their
work culture, physical work environment, discrimination at work, job
fringe benefits, and labor unions, as well as child care provisions,
nature of time spent with children and spouse, use of leisure time, and
electoral participation. Demographic variables provide information on
age, sex, marital status, race, place of birth, education, and income.

Abstract
During a recent study of how 1991 federal sentencing guidelines have affected the penalties that federal courts impose on public corporations, we performed an independent evaluation of the quality of the data on corporate sanctions that the U.S. Sentencing Commission releases to the public. Our initial findings led us to use other, independently-compiled data for our own research. This paper presents the main findings of our evaluation, which focused on the quality of the Commission's 1988-1996 (ICPSR) data on public corporations. First, the Commission's post-Guidelines data on penalties for public corporations appear to be incomplete and non-representative of the underlying case population. For example, the ICPSR post-1991 data appear to exclude a disproportionate number of large fines imposed on public corporations. No similar difficulties in the ICPSR pre-Guidelines (1988-1989) data were found. Shortfalls in the post-Guidelines data on other kinds of defendants, such as individuals, appear to be less marked. Second, the Commission's data are missing variables that may explain a substantial part of the case-by-case variation that occurs in sentencing. The data reveal little about the harm caused by the offense, which is often estimated in court papers. Also missing is information about the identity of the sentencing judge and about the identity of the corporation being sentenced. We review the history of the Commission's efforts to collect data on federal sentencing, highlighting institutional constraints and other factors that appear relevant to the difficulties we have found in the data that the Commission releases to the public.

American National Election Study, 1996: Pre- and Post-Election Survey
Summary
View help for Summary
This study is part of a time-series collection of national
surveys fielded continuously since 1948, designed to present data on
Americans' social backgrounds, enduring political predispositions,
social and political values, perceptions and evaluations of groups and
candidates, opinions on questions of public policy, and participation
in political life. The 1996 National Election Study contains both a pre-
and a post-election component. The pre-election survey includes
interviews in which approximately 77 percent of the cases are empaneled respondents who were first interviewed in the ANES 1992 TIME SERIES STUDY
(ICPSR 6067) or the ANES 1994 TIME SERIES STUDY (ICPSR 6507), or both. The other 23 percent of the pre-election cases are a freshly drawn cross-section sample. Of the 1,714 citizens interviewed during the pre-election stage, 1,534 (89.5 percent) also participated in the post-election survey: 1,197 of these
respondents were panel cases and 337 were cross-section. The content of the 1996
Election Study reflects its dual function, both as a traditional
presidential election year time-series data collection and as a panel
study. Substantive themes presented in the 1996 questionnaires
included interest in political campaigns, evaluations of the political parties, knowledge and evaluation of the presidential
and House candidates, political participation (including turnout in
the presidential primaries and in the November general election as well as
other forms of electoral campaign activity), and vote choices for
president, the United States House of Representatives, and the United
States Senate. Additional items focus on perceptions of personal and national economic well-being, positions on social welfare issues like the role of government in the provision of jobs and a good standard of living, positions on social issues (including abortion, women's roles, and prayer in the schools),
racial and ethnic stereotypes, opinions on affirmative action,
attitudes toward immigrants, opinions about the nation's most
important problems, political predispositions, social altruism, social
networks, feeling thermometers for a wide range of political
figures and political groups, affinity with various social groups. The 1996 study also includes new measures related to the dynamics of the congressional campaign, questions regarding the importance of issues, and the respondents' level of certainty regarding their expressed opinions, as well as new items about crime, the environment, gun control and income inequality. An eight-minute module of questions included in the post-election survey was developed by a consortium of electoral scholars from 52 polities to facilitate  comparative analysis of political attitudes and voting behavior. Social capital items assess trust in people and government as well as membership and activity in a wide variety of social, political, religious, and civic organizations. A full complement of variables on group membership and participation is also available in the Group Membership File which can be merged with the Main Data File. Detailed demographic information is provided, as well as measures of religious affiliation and religiosity.

2016-09-20 The documentation for variables V961454 and V960005B was corrected in DS1: Main Data File. The SPSS, SAS, and Stata setup files as well as the SPSS and Stata system files and the SAS transport file were updated. A tab-delimited data file and an R data file were added to the collection. The codebooks were updated. Respondent booklets were added to the data collection instruments in the codebook for DS1: Main Data File.
2015-11-10 The study metadata was updated.
2005-05-23 Descriptive variables concerning group
membership have been added to this study as Part 2, Auxiliary File
With Group Membership Variables, and the documentation for variable
V961454 was corrected in the new file. The data are available in
additional file formats, and the codebook is now available as a PDF
file.
2000-04-18 Contextual variables have been added to
the data file. Data for this study are now available in SAS transport
and SPSS export formats in addition to the ASCII data file. Variables
in the dataset have been renumbered to the following format: 2-digit
(or 2-character) prefix + 4 digits + [optional] 1-character suffix.
The codebook and SAS and SPSS setup files have been revised to reflect
these changes and to incorporate changes previously noted in
errata. Column locations listed in the codebook appendix have been
updated. The Match File and Missing Value File (formerly Parts 2 and
3, for use with 2nd release data) are no longer being distributed.
1998-07-15 New time-series weights have been added
to this 3rd release of the collection as an alternative to the
time-series weights available in Release 2. There is now a new weight
for 1996 pre-election variables and a new weight for 1996
post-election variables. A stand-alone ""match"" file consisting of
three variables -- V960001, the 1996 case ID, and V960005A and
V960005B, the weight variables -- is provided as Part 2 of the
collection for users who wish to merge this information into 1996
files previously downloaded. Also, changes to some missing data codes
have been made for several variables (V961189-V961192), and are
included as Part 3 of the collection. The DK values have been restored
to these cases, as they previously were included as blank or NA
cases. In addition, the following lesser changes were made: One case
with an incorrect 1994 case ID has been corrected. Several variable
label corrections have been made. The Candidate List (Appendix G in
the 2nd release) has been renamed Appendix H. Appendix G is now the
full technical report for the additional weight variables. The CPS
two-digit Occupation Master Codes, which are required for the
occupation coding of the respondent's father, have been included with
the Appendix E set of 1996 Master Codes. (These Master Codes were
omitted in the codebook included with Release 2.) The codebook and SAS
and SPSS setup files have been revised to reflect these changes to the
collection.
1997-04-30 ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:
Created variable labels and/or value labels.
Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.

Analysis Information
Weight
View help for Weight
Weight variables are V960003, V960004, V960005, V960005A, and V960005B. V960003 is a full-sample weight that incorporates a household non-response adjustment factor, the within-household selection weight, and a post-stratification factor by age, sex, and region. The panel weight V960004 is constructed for longitudinal analysis. V960005, the ""time series"" weight, adjusts only for panel aging and attrition, and should be used when comparing the panel cases or the total sample to previous unweighted studies. V960005A and V960005B were constructed to correct for the under-representation of younger and less educated respondents and for the resulting contribution to voting overestimation. V960005A adjusts for household non-response, weights for within-household selection, and is post-stratified by age and education, with V960005B as a corresponding weight adjusted for attrition between pre-election and post-election studies. It is not intended that analysis be undertaken using the fresh cross component alone.

The Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study
(CAS), a multi-round survey that interviewed students in four-year
colleges, examined key issues in alcohol abuse and other high risk
behaviors among college students, including the relationship of state
alcohol control measures and college policies to alcohol use and the
role of fraternities and sororities, easy access to alcohol, and low
alcohol prices. As in the previous rounds of CAS, which were conducted
in 1993 (ICPSR 6577), 1997 (ICPSR 3163), and 1999 (ICPSR 3818), this
round collected information on students' use of alcohol, tobacco, and
illicit drugs, views on campus alcohol policies and student alcohol
use, reasons for drinking alcohol and reasons for not drinking or
limiting drinking, and personal difficulties caused by drinking
problems (e.g., missed classes and trouble with police). Additional
topics covered by the survey include overall health status, daily
activities, satisfaction with education being received, grade-point
average, living arrangements, social life, sexual activity
(heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual), use of condoms during sexual
intercourse, rape, and drunk driving. Background variables include
age, height, weight, sex, marital status, religion, mother's and
father's education, mother's and father's drinking habits, race, and
Hispanic origin.

The Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study
(CAS), a multi-round survey that interviewed students in four-year
colleges, examined key issues in alcohol abuse and other high risk
behaviors among college students, including the relationship of state
alcohol control measures and college policies to alcohol use and the
role of fraternities and sororities, easy access to alcohol, and low
alcohol prices."

Following David Lee's pioneering work, numerous scholars have applied the regression discontinuity (RD) design to popular elections. Contrary to the assumptions of RD, however, we show that bare winners and bare losers in U.S. House elections (1942–2008) differ markedly on pretreatment covariates. Bare winners possess large
ex ante
financial, experience, and incumbency advantages over their opponents and are usually the candidates predicted to win by
Congressional Quarterly
's pre-election ratings. Covariate imbalance actually worsens in the closest House elections. National partisan tides help explain these patterns. Previous works have missed this imbalance because they rely excessively on model-based extrapolation. We present evidence suggesting that sorting in close House elections is due mainly to activities on or before Election Day rather than postelection recounts or other manipulation. The sorting is so strong that it is impossible to achieve covariate balance between matched treated and control observations, making covariate adjustment a dubious enterprise. Although RD is problematic for postwar House elections, this example does highlight the design's advantages over alternatives: RD's assumptions are clear and weaker than model-based alternatives, and their implications are empirically testable.

Abstract
CoreTrustSeal Data Repository certification is meant to demonstrate to researchers that data repositories are taking appropriate measures to ensure sustainable and trustworthy data infrastructures. Certification also improves repository processes and procedures through measurement against a community standard. CoreTrustSeal began issuing certifications in 2017 and replaces the Data Seal of Approval (DSA) certification and World Data System (WDS) Regular Members certification. The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) was one of the first six data repositories to earn the Data Seal of Approval in 2011. ICPSR earned the World Data System certification in 2013.
This presentation, given at the International Association for Social Science Information Services and Technology (IASSIST) conference on May 29, 2019 in Sydney, NSW, Australia, discussed ICPSR's experiences going through the new CoreTrustSeal certification process, including the effort required to apply for certification, the differences from the earlier repository certifications, and the lessons learned from the process.

Summary
View help for Summary
These data provide information on the number of arrests reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program each month by police agencies in the United States. Although not as well known as the ''Crimes Known to the Police'' data drawn from the Uniform Crime Report's Return A form, the arrest reports by age, sex, and race provide valuable data on 43 offenses including violent, drug, gambling, and larceny crimes. The data received by ICPSR were structured as a hierarchical file containing (per reporting police agency) an agency header record, and 1 to 12 monthly header reports, and 1 to 43 detail offense records containing the counts of arrests by age, sex, and race for a particular offense. ICPSR restructured the original data to a rectangular format.

Description
Data ingest -- the process by which data and related materials are deposited with an archive -- is the crucial entry point upon which all subsequent curation, preservation, and dissemination activities rely. Ingest includes describing and transferring files, as well as obtaining legal permissions necessary to establish adequate legal and intellectual control over digital objects. This presentation discusses recent activities at ICPSR to optimize the data ingest process. By optimization, we mean making the process as easy and convenient for the depositor while gathering as much information about the data collection to enable reuse and preservation.   Specific discussion points will include (1) a brief history of ICPSR's data ingest process; (2) a comparison of other archives' data ingest processes; (3) recent improvements and enhancements to the ICPSR data ingest process, including from a major update in June 2017; and (4) lessons learned from the June 2017 update.

Summary
View help for Summary
The Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods
(PHDCN) was a large-scale, interdisciplinary study of how families,
schools, and neighborhoods affect child and adolescent development.
One component of the PHDCN was the Longitudinal Cohort Study, which
was a series of coordinated longitudinal studies that followed over
6,000 randomly selected children, adolescents, and young adults, and
their primary caregivers over time to examine the changing
circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics,
that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial
behaviors. Numerous measures were administered to respondents to
gauge various aspects of human development, including individual
differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences. For
primary caregivers included in Wave 3 but not in Wave 2, an addendum
interview was administered consisting of measures or portions of
measures from the Wave 2 interview. This included questions from

Methodology
Study Purpose
View help for Study Purpose
Project on Human Development in Chicago
Neighborhoods
The Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN)
was a large-scale, interdisciplinary study of how families, schools,
and neighborhoods affect child and adolescent development. It was
designed to advance the understanding of the developmental pathways of
both positive and negative human social behaviors. In particular, the
project examined the causes and pathways of juvenile delinquency,
adult crime, substance abuse, and violence. At the same time, the
project provided a detailed look at the environments in which these
social behaviors took place by collecting substantial amounts of data
about urban Chicago, including its people, institutions, and
resources.
Longitudinal Cohort Study
One component of the PHDCN was the Longitudinal Cohort Study, which
was a series of coordinated longitudinal studies that followed over
6,000 randomly selected children, adolescents, and young adults, and
their primary caregivers over time to examine the changing
circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics,
that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial
behaviors. The age cohorts include birth (0), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18
years. Numerous measures were administered to respondents to gauge
various aspects of human development, including individual
differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences.
Addendum (Primary Caregiver)
The data in this collection are from Wave 3 of the Longitudinal
Cohort Study, which was administered between 2000 and 2002. The data
files contain information from the Addendum (Primary Caregiver)
protocol. The Addendum (Primary Caregiver) instrument was administered
to primary caregivers included in Wave 3 but not in Wave 2, and it
consisted of measures or portions of measures from the Wave 2
interview.
Study Design
View help for Study Design
Project on Human Development in Chicago
Neighborhoods
The city of Chicago was selected as the research site for the PHDCN
because of its extensive racial, ethnic, and social-class diversity.
The project collapsed 847 census tracts in the city of Chicago into
343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) based upon seven groupings of
racial/ethnic composition and three levels of socioeconomic status.
The NCs were designed to be ecologically meaningful. They were
composed of geographically contiguous census tracts, and geographic
boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered
in the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately
8,000 people.
Longitudinal Cohort Study
For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample
of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21
strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with
the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to
eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic
status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected
at random within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing
of dwelling units was collected for all sampled block groups.
Pregnant women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts
(birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through
in-person screening of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the
80 NCs. The screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within
six months of the birthday that qualified them for the sample were
selected for inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of
8,347 participants were identified through the screening. Of the
eligible study participants, 6,228 were interviewed in the Wave 1 data
collection, 5,338 were interviewed in the Wave 2 data collection, and
4,850 were interviewed in the Wave 3 data collection.
Data collection for Wave 3 began in 2000 and ended in 2002. It
included a letter sent to study participants notifying them that they
would be contacted to schedule an interview. Additional information on
the contact log included the dates and research assistant ID of the
Wave 2 interview (or the status of the case if incomplete in Wave 2),
a list of household composition and ID numbers of other household
members in the study, the name the telephone was listed under, the
recontact information from Waves 1 and 2, and an updated history of
addresses.
For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the
child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to
spend the most time taking care of the child. Separate research
assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child
interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face
interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the
personal interview were administered a phone interview. An abbreviated
telephone interview was conducted for the primary caregivers in
Cohorts 0-15 and Cohort 18 study participants in Wave 3 who lived
outside the nine-county metropolitan area to which research assistants
were able to travel for interviews. In Wave 3, phone interviews were
also conducted with the study participants in Cohort 15. People who
refused to complete the two-hour in-person interview were administered
the phone interview. A total of 391 telephone interviews were
conducted during Wave 3, representing 6.3 percent of the sample.
Proxy interviews were conducted with study participants who were
emancipated minors (under 18 but married or living independently). The
study participants answered questions from the primary caregiver's
interview on the primary caregiver's behalf. In Wave 3, one primary
caregiver and eleven study participants (young adults) were
interviewed in jail. They were located in either the Cook County Jail
or in one of the state prisons. Those study participants in a state
system outside the nine-county area were also interviewed by phone.
Study participants in foster care could not be interviewed. The
Department of Children and Family Services did not allow interviews of
the foster parent or the child. Permission was granted for a brief
period in Wave 1, therefore there are some children in the sample who
could not be followed up in Waves 2 and 3. Some children were not in
foster care in Wave 1 but were placed in foster care by Wave 2 or
3. They were also not followed up. Lastly, some participants were
interviewed in Wave 3 but not in Wave 2, as they were in foster care
during Wave 2.
Some participants in Wave 1 spoke a language other than English,
Spanish, or Polish. In Wave 3, an abbreviated version of the primary
caregiver's protocol was administered, and the research assistant
arranged for someone in the household to translate on the spot. In
Wave 3, the complete protocol was translated into Spanish.
Depending on the age and wave of data collection, participants were
paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other incentives, such as free
passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly drawing prizes, were also
included.
Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For
example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking
traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,
delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and
self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also
interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,
parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental
health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.
For primary caregivers included in Wave 3 but not in Wave 2, an
addendum interview was administered consisting of measures or portions
of measures from the Wave 2 interview. An addendum was also given to
the Cohort 15 and 18 study participants who were not included in Wave
2. A total of 164 primary caregivers and 62 young adult (Cohorts 15
and 18) addendums were completed in Wave 3.
Addendum (Primary Caregiver)
This addendum collected information from an assortment of
instruments that the primary caregiver had missed in Wave 2. From
PROJECT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN):
DEMOGRAPHIC FILE, WAVE 2, 1997-2000 (ICPSR 13609), basic demographic
information was collected regarding the subject, primary caregiver,

SUICIDE INTERVIEW, WAVE 2, 1997-2000 (ICPSR 13623), information was
obtained regarding any members of the subject's family who had
committed suicide. From PROJECT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO
NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN): HOUSEHOLD COMPOSITION, WAVE 2, 1997-2000 (ICPSR
13628), information was obtained regarding the composition of the
subject's household, asking the respondent to provide information
about each member of the household including age, gender, and
relationship to the subject. Information for up to 17 possible
individuals could have been listed for this part. From PROJECT ON
HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN): HEALTH SCREEN,
WAVE 2, 1997-2000 (ICPSR 13629), information was obtained regarding
the general health condition of the subjects. From PROJECT ON HUMAN

PROJECT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN): HEALTH
SCREEN, WAVE 2, 1997-2000 (ICPSR 13629), the data files contain
information regarding the general health condition of the subjects
including whether the subject ever had any of a long list of
conditions or diseases such as scoliosis, hepatitis, sickle cell
anemia, or meningitis. Information was also collected pertaining to
ways the subject may have been classified by a school or health
professional such as learning disabled, physically handicapped,
mentally retarded, etc. A number of questions were asked regarding
services the subject may have ever received in or out of school. The
services included such things as special education classes, physical
therapy, tutoring, etc. From PROJECT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO
NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN): PRENATAL AND EARLY HEALTH, WAVE 2, 1997-2000
(ICPSR 13644), the data files include information relating to the
mother's pregnancy and delivery of the subject, as well as questions
regarding the subject's early health. Respondents were asked if the
subject's mother received any prenatal care, whether there were
medical problems during the pregnancy, and how many times the
subject's mother was hospitalized while pregnant. If the respondent
was the biological mother, she was asked whether she had wanted to
become pregnant at that time, how many drinks of alcohol she had had
while pregnant, how many cigarettes she had smoked while pregnant, and
whether she had used drugs while pregnant. Respondents were asked
about the timeliness of the subject's birth, how much weight the
subject's mother gained during pregnancy, and whether the subject's
mother had had serious problems with the delivery. There were also
questions asking how long the mother and the subject had been in the
hospital, whether the subject had had to go into the hospital
overnight since first coming home from the hospital, and if so, for
how long. There was also a series of questions regarding any ear
infections the subject had had.

Summary
View help for Summary
This survey (HCC2) is a component of the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation's Health Tracking Initiative, an initiative
designed to track changes in the the American health care system and
their effects. HCC2 reinterviewed respondents to the first National
Survey of Alcohol, Drug, and Mental Health Problems (HCC1) and a
cross-section of adult respondents from the second Community Tracking
Study (CTS) Household Survey (CTS2). Previously, HCC1 reinterviewed a
cross-section of adult respondents from the first CTS Household Survey
(CTS1). HCC1 is available as the NATIONAL SURVEY OF ALCOHOL, DRUG, AND
MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS [HEALTHCARE FOR COMMUNITIES], 1997-1998 (ICPSR
3025), CTS1 as the COMMUNITY TRACKING STUDY HOUSEHOLD SURVEY,
1996-1997, AND FOLLOWBACK SURVEY, 1997-1998 (ICPSR 2524), and CTS2 as
the COMMUNITY TRACKING STUDY HOUSEHOLD SURVEY, 1998-1999, AND
FOLLOWBACK SURVEY, 1998-2000 (ICPSR 3199). Central to the design of
the CTS Household Surveys, from which all HCC1 and HCC2 respondents
originated, is its community focus. Sixty sites (51 metropolitan and 9
nonmetropolitan areas) were randomly selected to form the core of the
CTS surveys and to be representative of the nation as a whole. The CTS
Household Surveys were administered to households in the 60 CTS sites
(known as the site sample) and to a supplemental national sample of
households. Both HCC1 and HCC2 focused on the care and treatment for
alcohol, drug, and mental health conditions. Like HCC1, the HCC2
questionnaire collected information on (1) demographics, (2) health
and daily activities, (3) mental health, (4) alcohol and illicit drug
use, (5) use of medications, (6) general health insurance and
insurance coverage for mental health, substance abuse, and
prescription medications, (7) access, utilization, and quality of
behavioral health care, (8) labor market status, income, and wealth,
and (9) life difficulties. Three sets of a data files are supplied
with this collection: a set containing the interviews completed with
the follow-up sample of persons who responded to HCC1, a set
containing the interviews completed with the cross-sectional sample of
subjects who responded to CTS2, and a set named the ""complete sample""
which contains all of the completed interviews. Five imputed versions
of the data are included with each set for analysis with multiple
imputation techniques.

Methodology
Sample
View help for Sample
HCC2 followed the individuals who responded to the HCC1
survey (those who originated in the CTS1 site sample and those who
originated in the CTS1 supplemental sample) and drew a new
cross-sectional random sample out of the CTS2 site sample
respondents. All of the HCC1 respondents (n = 9,585) were selected for
the follow-up sample of which 6,659 responded to HCC2. Among the
follow-up respondents, 2,410 were also interviewed in the 60 CTS sites
by CTS2. The cross-sectional respondents comprised these 2,410
individuals plus another 5,499 adult respondents who were randomly
selected from among the CTS2 site sample respondents. In HCC1,
information reported by CTS1 respondents was used to oversample among
low-income respondents, individuals who had used specialty mental
health services in the preceding year, and individuals who had
reported high psychological distress. The selection of the latter
5,499 cross-sectional respondents oversampled the same groups as well
as individuals who reported that they had seen a doctor or other
healthcare professional for alcohol-related problems in the past two
years. As in HCC1, individuals from low intensity sites were
oversampled relative to high intensity sites.

Summary
View help for Summary
The United States Historical Election Returns Series consists of several datasets, the major files are the United States Historical Election Returns, 1788-1968 (ICPSR 00001) and General Election Data for the United States, 1950-1990  (ICPSR 00013). ICPSR 00001 includes county-level returns for over 90
percent of all elections to the offices of president, governor, United
States representative (1824-1990), and United States senator (1912-1990).The dataset also includes returns for approximately two-thirds of all elections to the offices of president, governor, and United States representative for the period 1788-1823. Study ICPSR 00013 contains county-level returns for all elections to the same national and state offices, plus one additional state-wide office, usually attorney general or secretary of state.
This data collection provides summary information about candidates contesting elections and special elections anywhere in the nation, political party name and ICPSR party ID code, and the number of votes received by each candidate in the constituency for elections between 1788 and 1990. The information also include election for which returns are available solely at the constituency level and not found in the country-level files of elections returns described above. For detailed information about candidates and contests, please refer to study Constituency Statistics of Elections in the United States, 1788-1990 (ICPSR 7757).
This release further include 1990 data from the District of Columbia election for United States senator and United States representative. The offices of two senators and one representative were created by the ""District of Columbia Statehood Constitutional Convention Initiative,"" which was approved by District voters in 1980. Elections for these offices were postponed until the 1990 general election. The three offices are currently local District positions, which will turn into federal offices if the District becomes a state.

The primary election is held to nominate candidates from the major political parties (Democratic, Republican, and D.C. Statehood) to the general election ballot. In the general election, each party nominee will appear on the ballot, along with any independent and minor party candidates who qualify for the ballot directly by obtaining the required number of voter signatures on nominating petitions.
To have appeared on the ballot in a primary election, a candidate for Senator or Representative needed to collect
the signatures of one percent of the voters registered   within his or her party, or 2,000 signatures, whichever is  less. To have appeared on the ballot in the general election (as an independent or minor party candidate), the candidate needed to collect signatures of 3,000 registered voters.
This collection is part of the
United States Historical Election Returns Series
.
ICPSR has not confirmed the accuracy of the provided data. Further review of candidates' names and FIPS codes may be recommended.

View help for Summary
To serve the scholarly community's growing interest in the
process of democratization in the world over the past 200 years, this
data collection consists of a compiled database that assesses 187 (20
historical and 167 contemporary) sovereign countries from 1800-2005.
The database was constructed by merging variables derived from these
existing datasets: (1) POLITY III: REGIME TYPE AND POLITICAL AUTHORITY
1800-1994 (Jagger and Gurr 1995) [ICPSR 6695], (2) CROSS-NATIONAL TIME
SERIES, 1815-1973 (Banks 1993) [ICPSR 7412], (3) Polity IV (Jagger and
Gurr 2005), (4) Political Freedom Indicators (Freedom House 2000), (5)
World Development Indicators 1960-1998 (World Bank 1999), and (6)
World Development Indicators 1960-2005 (World Bank 2006). In addition,
missing variables were coded from the Statesman's Yearbook (2000), the
World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators (Taylor and Jodice
1983), Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Relations
(Osmanczyk 1982), and the journal, ""Freedom Review,"" published by
Freedom House. A sovereign country was defined as an independent
member of the international system, which had a population greater
than 500,000. In the database, for each sovereign country there are
over 120 indicators, annually recorded, that represent: (1) the level
of democratic growth, (2) the countries' development depicted by
socioeconomic, demographic, and geographical characteristics, and (3)
diffusion indicators. In addition, to add precision to the
measurement, modifications of the core indicators were also
recorded. The database is complimented by an index of variables.

Analysis Information
Weight
View help for Weight
To complement and to test the derived data of Polity III and
Polity IV and the World Bank and Banks data, data derived from two
different sources on overlapping years were correlated. The obtained
correlations' scores were above 0.9. The most complex was testing used
to assess Polity III and Polity IV data. For testing of Polity data,
the principal investigator rendered the Freedom House scale scores of
democracy compatible with Jagger and Gurr's Polity III scale.
Accordingly, the 13-point democracy scale used by Freedom House was
modified to the 11-point scale used in Polity III. To assess the
comparability of the Polity III data with the rescaled Freedom House
indicator, the Freedom House indicators were derived for 161 countries
for the years 1990-1994, and then correlated with the Polity index for
the same years. The correlation was r = 0.97 (p less than 0.01). Each component
was weighted 0-3 or 0-4 based on the presence of 2-7 variables per
component, and a total democratization score was the sum of the five
component weights. The comparability of Polity III with Freedom House
data was assessed by correlating the two sets of data, and the
obtained correlation score was above 0.90 (p less than 0.01).

PPCS 2008
Summary
View help for Summary
The Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS) provides detailed information on the nature and characteristics of face-to-face contacts between police and the public, including the reason for and outcome of the contact. The PPCS interviews a nationally representative sample of United States residents aged 16 years or older as a supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey. To date, the PPCS has been conducted five times by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS):
The first survey -- described in the BJS publication Police Use of Force: Collection of National Data
(NCJ 165040) -- documented levels of contacts with police during 1996.
The second survey -- described in Contacts between Police and the Public: Findings from the
1999 National Survey (NCJ 184957) -- recorded police-citizen contacts in 1999. These data are
archived as POLICE-PUBLIC CONTACT SURVEY, 1999: [UNITED STATES] (ICPSR 3151).
The third survey -- described in Contacts between Police and the Public: Findings from the 2002
National Survey (NCJ 207845) -- covered interactions between police and the public in 2002. These data are archived as POLICE-PUBLIC CONTACT SURVEY, 2002: [UNITED STATES] (ICPSR 4273).
The fourth survey -- described in the BJS publication, Contacts between Police and the Public, 2005 (NCJ 215243) -- covered interactions between police and the public in 2005. These data are archived as POLICE-PUBLIC CONTACT SURVEY, 2005: [UNITED STATES] (ICPSR 20020).
The fifth survey -- described in the BJS publication, Contacts between Police and the Public, 2008 (NCJ 234599) -- covered interactions between police and the public in 2008. These data are archived as POLICE-PUBLIC CONTACT SURVEY, 2008 (ICPSR 32022).

Methodology
Study Design
View help for Study Design
The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is an annual survey that collects data on crime against persons aged
12 years or older from a nationally representative, stratified, multistage cluster sample of United States households. Since 1999, the
Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS) has been administered every 3 years as a supplemental survey to all persons aged 16 years or older within households sampled for the NCVS.
The United States Census Bureau fielded the 2008 PPCS questionnaire, processed the survey data, and provided estimation specifications. The 2008 PPCS was pretested in the spring of 2008 and conducted between July 1, 2008, and December 31, 2008. Respondents were asked about their contacts with police during the past 12 months. For instance, persons interviewed in July 2008 were asked about contacts that occurred between August 2007 and July 2008. Those interviewed in August 2008 were asked about contacts between September 2007 and August 2008.
In 2008 the PPCS interviewed 57,978 of the 72,566 eligible individuals in the NCVS sample. A total of 14,588 nonrespondents who were excluded from the 2008 PPCS as non-interviews or as proxy interviews. Non-interviews (12,803) included respondents not available for the interview, those who refused to participate, and non-English speaking respondents. (Unlike the NCVS interviews, PPCS interviews are conducted only in English.) The remaining 1,785 were proxy interviews representing household members who were unable to participate for physical, mental, or other reasons. After adjustment for nonresponse, the sample cases in 2008 were weighted to produce a national population estimate of 236,511,832 persons aged 16 years or older.

Project Description
Summary
View help for Summary
This data collection represents an attempt to apply recent
methodological developments in the measurement of time use to a
national probability sample of United States households in order to
facilitate development of a fully articulated system of economic and
social accounts. The data for this study were collected from a sample
of 2,406 adults (1,519 respondents and 887 spouses) first interviewed
in October-November 1975, and reinterviewed three more times in
February, May, and September 1976. Respondents were asked to keep a
diary of daily activities so that time allocation patterns could be
estimated for the entire year. In addition to the basic estimates of
time use obtained from the diaries, the four waves of interviewing
obtained information on the employment status of the respondent and
spouse, the earnings and other income of the respondent and spouse,
the ""consumption benefits"" for activities engaged in, the health,
friendships, and associations of the respondents, the stock of
technology available to the household, the house repair and
maintenance activities of the family, the division of labor in
household work and related attitudes, the physical characteristics of
the respondents' housing structure, net worth and housing values, the
job characteristics of the respondent and spouse, and the
characteristics of mass media usage on a typical day. Background
variables include marital status, education, religion, and political
preference. AMERICAN'S USE OF TIME, 1965-1976, AND TIME USE IN
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ACCOUNTS, 1975-1976: MERGED DATA (ICPSR 7796) is a
data collection that combines this study with a similar one.

The data collection contains complete data for the
1,519 respondents plus data for the 887 spouses of respondents. It is
formatted to allow utilization of the spouses as additional
respondents. This was done in order to facilitate analysis of data
collected from respondents and their corresponding spouses and to take
full advantage of the total number of individuals who were
interviewed. The user makes the decision to use or not use the
supplemental sample depending on her/his particular analysis plan and
the validity of the particular variables to be used. Weight variables
have been included in the file to account for the bias added by
counting husband and wife each as separate respondents.

NIBRS, 2008
Summary
View help for Summary
The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) is a
part of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR), administered by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In the late 1970s, the law
enforcement community called for a thorough evaluative study of the
UCR with the objective of recommending an expanded and enhanced UCR
program to meet law enforcement needs into the 21st century. The FBI
fully concurred with the need for an updated program to meet
contemporary needs and provided its support, formulating a
comprehensive redesign effort. Following a multiyear study, a
""Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program"" was
developed. Using the ""Blueprint,"" and in consultation with local and
state law enforcement executives, the FBI formulated new guidelines
for the Uniform Crime Reports. The National Incident-Based Reporting
System (NIBRS) was implemented to meet these guidelines. NIBRS data
are archived at ICPSR as 13 separate data files per year, which may be
merged by using linkage variables. The data focus on a variety of
aspects of a crime incident. Part 4, Administrative Segment, offers
data on the incident, itself (date and time). Each crime incident is
delineated by one administrative segment record. Also provided are
Part 5, Offense Segment (offense type, location, weapon use, and bias
motivation), Part 6, Property Segment (type of property loss, property
description, property value, drug type and quantity), Part 7, Victim
Segment (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and injuries), Part 8, Offender
Segment (age, sex, and race), and Part 9, Arrestee Segment (arrest
date, age, sex, race, and weapon use). The Batch Header Segment (Parts
1-3) separates and identifies individual police agencies by
Originating Agency Identifier (ORI). Batch Header information, which
is contained on three records for each ORI, includes agency name,
geographic location, and population of the area. Part 10, Group B
Arrest Report Segment, includes arrestee data for Group B crimes.
Window Segments files (Parts 11-13) pertain to incidents for which the
complete Group A Incident Report was not submitted to the FBI. In
general, a Window Segment record will be generated if the incident
occurred prior to January 1 of the previous year or if the incident
occurred prior to when the agency started NIBRS reporting. As with the
UCR, participation in NIBRS is voluntary on the part of law
enforcement agencies. The data are not a representative sample of
crime in the United States.

Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)
Description
The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) was founded over 50 years ago ""to
further the development of research in political science"" (Miller 1963:11). Since that summer of 1962, the scope
and range of services ICPSR offers has expanded significantly to encompass the wider social and behavioral
research community, and from a handful of data collections to thousands. With over 750 consortial members
from around the world, ICPSR is now a leader in preserving, curating, and providing access to scientific data so
others can reuse the data and validate research findings. Much of the success of ICPSR can be traced back to the
consortial model upon which the organization was founded, with members providing funding, input, and a sense
of community. This article describes the history and current status of the consortium, and discusses upcoming
challenges and opportunities.

Project Description
Summary
View help for Summary
This is the second survey in the Health Tracking Household Survey (HTHS) series, the successor to the Community Tracking Study (CTS) Household Surveys. The CTS Household Surveys were conducted in 1996-1997 (ICPSR 2524), 1998-1999 (ICPSR 3199), 2000-2001 (ICPSR 3764), and 2003 (ICPSR 4216), and the first HTHS survey was conducted in 2007 (ICPSR 26001). Although the HTHS questionnaires are similar to the CTS Household Survey questionnaires, the HTHS sampling design does not have the community focus intrinsic to CTS. Whereas the CTS design focused on 60 nationally representative communities with sample sizes large enough to draw conclusions about health system change in 12 communities, the HTHS design is a national sample not aimed at measuring change within communities. Hence, ""Community"" was dropped from the study title. Like the previous surveys, this survey collected information on health insurance coverage, use of health services, health expenses, satisfaction with health care and physician choice, unmet health care needs, usual source of care and patient trust, health status, and adult chronic conditions. In addition, the survey inquired about perceptions of care delivery and quality, problems with paying medical bills, use of in-store retail and onsite workplace health clinics, patient engagement with health care, sources of health information, and shopping for health care.
At the beginning of the interview, a household informant provided information about the composition of the household which was used to group the household members into family insurance units (FIU). Each FIU comprised an adult household member, his or her spouse or domestic partner (same sex and other unmarried partners), if any, and any dependent children 0-17 years of age or 18-22 years of age if a full-time student (even if living outside the household). In each FIU in the household, a FIU informant provided information on insurance coverage, health care use, usual source of care, and general health status of all FIU members. This informant also provided information on family income as well as employment, earnings, employer-offered insurance plans, and race/ethnicity for all adult FIU members. Moreover, every adult in each FIU (including the FIU informant) responded through a self-response module to questions that could not be answered reliably by proxy respondents, such as questions about unmet needs, usual source of care, assessments of the quality of care, consumer engagement, satisfaction with physician choice, use of health information, health care shopping, and detailed health questions. The FIU informants responded on behalf of children regarding unmet needs, satisfaction with physician choice, and use of health care information.

Methodology
Sample
View help for Sample
Households were selected using random-digit-dialing sampling of landline and cellular phones. This was the first HTHS/CTS survey to introduce a sample of cellular phone numbers.
The survey obtained information about every adult and one child under age 18 (if present) in each FIU. In FIUs with more than one child under age 18, one child was randomly selected for inclusion in the survey.

Abstract
Objective
To quantify the association between long working hours and alcohol use.
Design
Systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies and unpublished individual participant data.
Data sources
A systematic search of PubMed and Embase databases in April 2014 for published studies, supplemented with manual searches. Unpublished individual participant data were obtained from 27 additional studies.
Review methods
The search strategy was designed to retrieve cross sectional and prospective studies of the association between long working hours and alcohol use. Summary estimates were obtained with random effects meta-analysis. Sources of heterogeneity were examined with meta-regression.
Results
Cross sectional analysis was based on 61 studies representing 333 693 participants from 14 countries. Prospective analysis was based on 20 studies representing 100 602 participants from nine countries. The pooled maximum adjusted odds ratio for the association between long working hours and alcohol use was 1.11 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.18) in the cross sectional analysis of published and unpublished data. Odds ratio of new onset risky alcohol use was 1.12 (1.04 to 1.20) in the analysis of prospective published and unpublished data. In the 18 studies with individual participant data it was possible to assess the European Union Working Time Directive, which recommends an upper limit of 48 hours a week. Odds ratios of new onset risky alcohol use for those working 49-54 hours and ≥55 hours a week were 1.13 (1.02 to 1.26; adjusted difference in incidence 0.8 percentage points) and 1.12 (1.01 to 1.25; adjusted difference in incidence 0.7 percentage points), respectively, compared with working standard 35-40 hours (incidence of new onset risky alcohol use 6.2%). There was no difference in these associations between men and women or by age or socioeconomic groups, geographical regions, sample type (population based
v
occupational cohort), prevalence of risky alcohol use in the cohort, or sample attrition rate.
Conclusions
Individuals whose working hours exceed standard recommendations are more likely to increase their alcohol use to levels that pose a health risk.
Introduction
Risky alcohol use is common in high income countries, though there is cultural variation in alcohol use between countries; about one in four people are classified as at risk users, and 9% meet the diagnostic criteria for an alcohol use disorder.

Risky alcohol use, defined for example, as more than 14 drinks/week among women and more than 21 drinks/week among men,
5
6
7
refers to the level of alcohol consumption at which there might be an increased risk of adverse health consequences, such as liver diseases, cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, mental disorders, and injuries, as well as considerable social costs because of family disruption, violence, traffic incidents, healthcare costs, reduced work productivity, and permanent exclusion from the labour market.

Although risky alcohol use is common in the workforce,
3
little attention has been paid to any association with work. A recent large scale meta-analysis of data from individual participants provided no clear support for an association between perceived “job strain” (an index of work stress) and risky alcohol use.
9
Another work related factor—long working hours—has been associated with several adverse health outcomes that are linked to alcohol use, including cardiovascular diseases,
10
11

depression and anxiety,
11

15
16
sleep deprivation,

16
and occupational injuries.
15
17
Direct evidence on the association between long working hours and alcohol use, however, is based on relatively small studies with insufficient power to detect weak or moderate associations. Three narrative reviews, published in 1999-2006, summarised findings from up to six studies that reported inconclusive results, some studies showing increased alcohol use among people with long working hours, and other studies observing no relation.
11
13
18
To date, there has been no systematic quantification of the link between long working hours and alcohol use.
Meta-analysis is a powerful tool to examine associations between exposures and health outcomes as it is based on a greater range of participants, a larger sample size, and more events than any individual study. A traditional meta-analysis of published studies is a quantitative synthesis of published aggregate data with a limited ability to control for the effects of publication bias (that is, selective reporting of positive findings) and heterogeneity in the methods used (for example, cut-off levels, method of measurement, analytic strategies, etc).
19
Meta-analysis of individual participant data provides an opportunity to deal with these biases by inclusion of unpublished individual level data to the analysis and by standardisation of definitions of the exposures, outcomes, and statistical methods within these data.
20
We carried out a meta-analysis of 36 published studies with aggregate data (34 cross sectional and two prospective), identified by a systematic review and supplemented with unpublished individual participant data from 27 studies, of which 18 provided data for prospective analysis. We examined whether long working hours are associated with alcohol use cross sectionally, longitudinally, and in relation to sustained risky alcohol use. We also examined whether any association is apparent across sociodemographic groups, geographical regions, and characteristics of the study cohort. Finally, we compared the findings from published studies and studies with unpublished individual participant data to evaluate publication bias.
Methods
Search strategy for published studies with aggregate data
We conducted the meta-analysis according to MOOSE guidelines.
21
We performed a systematic computerised literature search in PubMed and Embase (to April 2014). Exposure search terms, used without restrictions, were: “(work and hours) or (working and hours) or (overtime and work) or overtime”. Outcome search terms were: “alcohol or alcohols or ethanol or wine or beer or liquor or spirit or alcoholism or (alcohol and dependence) or (alcohol and abuse) or (substance) or (drinking and behaviour) or (alcohol and drinking) or (alcoholic and beverages) or (alcohol and consumption) or (alcohol and misuse) or (heavy and drinking) or lifestyle or (life and style) or (health and behaviours) or (health and behaviour)”. We also scrutinised the reference list of all eligible publications and performed a cited reference search of these using the Institute of Scientific Information Web of Science (to May 2014) to identify all studies citing the included studies.
Study selection criteria
We included published studies providing aggregate data if they met the following criteria: empirical and peer reviewed study; at least an abstract with estimates and/or full results published in English; individual level exposure and outcome data; examined the association between working hours and alcohol use (reported either by a defined high level of alcohol consumption or as a continuous variable); reported either estimates of relative risk, odds ratios, or hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals or data to calculate these. Cross sectional, case-control, prospective studies, and trials were eligible for this meta-analysis.
Data extraction from studies with aggregate data
We extracted the following information from each retrieved article: name of first author, start of follow-up (year) or publication year if start year not reported, study location (country), population, number of participants, mean follow-up time, mean age or age range, proportion of women, method of assessment and definition of long working hours, proportion of employees with long hours, method of assessment of alcohol use, definition of risky alcohol use (when applicable), proportion of employees with risky use at baseline and proportion of new cases at follow-up, and covariates included in the adjusted models.
Individual participant data
We also identified 28 datasets with relevant individual participant data. Of these, we excluded the Intervention Project on Absence and Well-being (IPAW) study
22
from the analysis because there were no cases of risky alcohol use among employees with long working hours. Of the remaining 27 datasets, we obtained 15 from the Individual-Participant-Data Meta-analysis in Working Populations (IPD-Work) Consortium, which we lead, and 12 from open access data collections. The IPD-Work consortium is a network of investigators established at a meeting in London in 2008 to pool cohort studies with data on work life and health. Individual participant data from 15 cohort studies with measurements of working hours and alcohol consumption were available from IPD-Work. Another source of unpublished data was from open access collections. These were retrieved from collections curated by the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR;
www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/
) and the UK Economic and Social Data Service (
http://ukdataservice.ac.uk/
). These repositories seek research data and pertinent documents from researchers, research agencies, and government entities and process, preserve, and disseminate the data and documents for researchers. We identified 12 additional studies with data on working hours and alcohol use from these two sources (see appendix 1 for a more detailed description). Each constituent study was approved by the relevant local or national ethics committee, and all participants gave informed consent to participate.
In line with previous evidence suggesting ≥55 hours of work a week to be harmful for health,
10
and the European Union Directive of a recommended limit of 48 hours a week,
23
we used the following categories of hours worked: <35, 35-40 (reference), 41-48, 49-54, and ≥55 hours. In the Helsinki Health Study,
24
weekly working hours were categorised as <30, 30-40, 41-50, and >50 in the response format. In our analyses, we used the >50 working hours group in the Helsinki Health Study to represent the ≥55 hours group and the 30-40 hours group as the reference group.
In all individual participant data studies, information on alcohol use was based on survey responses. We defined risky alcohol use by standard categorisations.
9
One drink was considered equivalent to one unit or one glass of alcoholic drink. Participants were classified as follows: non-use or moderate use (up to 14 drinks/week for women and up to 21 drinks/week for men), and risky alcohol use (>14 drinks/week and >21 drinks/week, respectively). According to public health guidelines, these limits define risky alcohol use among men and women in many countries.

participants were asked how often they drank beer, wine, spirits, and mixed drinks (0=never, 1=seldom, 2=once in a while, 3=regularly); and risky alcohol use was defined as score of 7 or more on the summed score of these four questions. In the US National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort,
26
risky alcohol use was defined as “binge drinking”—that is, having consumed six or more alcohol units in one evening at least twice during the past month. In the prospective cohort analyses of new onset risky alcohol use, we excluded cases of risky alcohol use at baseline.
Statistical analysis
We used a two stage meta-analysis
20
with study specific estimates obtained from published studies with aggregate data and studies with unpublished individual participant data at the first stage. The second stage was an analysis that pooled all the study specific estimates.
First stage analysis in studies with aggregate data
We converted means, correlation coefficients, and regression coefficients reported for continuous variables to odds ratios according to published formulas.
27
The studies with aggregate data had used different covariate adjustments. In two published studies, the exposure measure was a continuous variable estimating one hour increase in working hours with a dichotomous alcohol use outcome.
28
29
In these cases, we raised the estimate to the 18th power to get an estimate comparable with that in the individual participant data (≥55 hours
v
35-40 hours—that is, about an 18 hour difference).
First stage analysis in studies with individual participant data
We analysed data from the individual participant data studies to generate study level odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals within each study. These analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity (white/ethnic majority
v
other when available), and socioeconomic status, which was categorised as high, intermediate, and low. In the analyses of individual participant data, this three level socioeconomic status variable was based on register or survey based occupational position or educational qualification.
Second stage analysis
In both types of data, we used random effects meta-analysis to combine the results from the individual participant data analyses and the (converted) estimates of the aggregate data. We used odds ratios as an indicator of effect size and their 95% confidence intervals as an indicator of precision. We examined heterogeneity of the estimates by computing an I
2
statistic, presented the summary estimates of the random effects analyses, and assessed the possibility of publication bias in the analysis of published studies by using a funnel plot of the estimates against their standard errors and Egger’s test for small study effects.
We used cross sectional aggregate and individual participant data for prespecified meta-regression and stratified meta-analyses to examine sex (men only, women only, both), region (Europe, North America, Australia/New Zealand, Asia), number of adjustment variables (none, sociodemographics, multivariable), and population (random sample of the population, occupational cohort with several occupations, occupational cohort with a single occupation (except physicians), physicians, patients) as sources of heterogeneity between studies. In the prospective analysis the corresponding variables were sex, age (<50
v
≥50), socioeconomic status, region (North America, United Kingdom, other Europe, Australia), sample type (population based/community sample
v
occupational cohort), the baseline level of alcohol use in the cohort (<9%
v
≥9%), and participation rate in the prospective cohort (<75%
v
≥75%). We used SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC) and Stata 13.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) to analyse study specific data and Stata 13.1 for meta-analyses.
Results
Aggregate data from published studies
The literature search identified 3409 citations from PubMed and 2314 from Embase, of which 651 were selected for further review (fig 1
⇓
). Of these, 26 fulfilled the eligibility criteria. We identified 10 additional eligible studies from a manual search of the references of the retrieved relevant publications (including reviews and books) and the cited reference search of the articles that were selected for meta-analysis. In total, there were 36 eligible published studies with aggregate data, of which 34 were cross sectional and two were cohort studies.

the association between long working hours and alcohol use was not the main topic of the study—that is, either long working hours or alcohol use were covariates, and unadjusted estimates were usually displayed in a descriptive table.
There was large variation in the assessment of working hours in published studies with aggregate data: 20 studies used a threshold of 45 hours a week or higher

With the exception of two studies,

the studies that treated working hours as a continuous variable also treated alcohol use measure as a continuous variable and reported a correlation or linear regression coefficient between the exposure and outcome (see table A in appendix 2). Two studies calculated the difference in mean alcohol use between groups of working long and shorter hours.
39
62
Probably in part because of large variation in the definition, the prevalence of working long hours also varied substantially, ranging from 4.1% to 69.8%. Alcohol use was based on self reported frequency from questionnaires or amount of alcohol use, except in one study that used the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) to determine DSM-IV diagnoses of alcohol use disorders.
58
There was also large variation in the definition of risky alcohol use; and its prevalence between studies ranged from 3.4% to 64.0%.

Of the studies, 26 provided hourly data on daily or weekly working hours, and in one study the number of hours was pre-categorised.
24
The cross sectional data from the 27 individual participant data studies came from 194 581 participants (89 799 men, 104 782 women). The proportion of employees working long hours (≥55/week) at baseline ranged from 0.8% to 20.2% across the studies (overall 7.5%). The prevalence of risky alcohol use at baseline (n=22 857 cases) varied from 2.3% to 38.8%, and the overall prevalence was 11.7%. Eighteen prospective cohorts provided data from a second wave, which allowed us to calculate new onset risky alcohol use. The prospective data included 93 729 participants (36 342 men, 57 387 women), the follow-up time ranged from 3.4 to 21.9 years (mean 6.0 person years), and the proportion of participants with new onset risky alcohol use (n=5878 new cases) ranged from 1.2% to 17.4%; overall new onset was 6.3%.
Cross sectional association between working hours and alcohol use
The overall pooled odds ratio of the association between long working hours and alcohol use in the meta-analysis of 61 cross sectional studies was 1.11 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.18). Similar associations were found in the 27 individual participant data studies (1.10, 1.04 to 1.18; fig 2
⇓
) and published studies with aggregate data (1.12, 1.02 to 1.22; fig 3
⇓
). The I
2
statistics suggested significant heterogeneity among published studies with aggregate data (I
2
=81%, P<0.001) but not individual participant data (I
2
=18%, P=0.21). The total pooled I
2
was 72%, with P<0.001. In the individual participant data, the overall prevalence of risky alcohol use was 11.8%.

We examined the potential sources for heterogeneity in the aggregate data: sex (men only, women only, both), region (Europe, North America, Australia/New Zealand, Asia), covariate adjustments (none, sociodemographics, multivariate), and population (random sample of the population, occupational cohort with several occupations, occupational cohort with a single occupation (excluding physicians), physicians, patients). Meta-regression models provided no evidence that any of these factors explained the heterogeneity (data not shown; all P>0.11).
To examine whether a stricter definition of the exposure and outcome would provide different results in the cross sectional studies with aggregate data, we carried out a meta-analysis in a refined subgroup of studies that fulfilled the following criteria: the exposure and outcome were categorical; the cut point defining long hours was high enough (that is, it did not include employees with working hours close to standard hours, such as 41 hours); the reference group did not include employees with long working hours (such as 50 hours); the outcome was based on a specific definition of risky alcohol use. Six studies were eligible for this analysis.

The odds ratio for risky alcohol use was 1.14 (95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.47) and the I

was 68.6% (P=0.007; data not shown), again suggesting a similar estimate but with considerably high heterogeneity among published studies.
The funnel plot for published cross sectional studies appears symmetrical (fig 4

) and is not dependent on whether long working hours and alcohol consumption was the main research question in the study or not. No evidence of an association between study size and the estimates was found in Egger’s test: 0.12 (95% confidence interval −0.38 to 0.63), P=0.62 for the total data; 0.10 (−0.71 to 0.90), P=0.81 for studies with long hours and alcohol use as the main research question; 0.22 (−0.58 to 1.02), P=0.57 for studies with another main research question.

Prospective association between long working hours and new onset risky alcohol use
In the meta-analysis of the 18 prospective individual participant data studies and two studies with published aggregate data, participants who used alcohol above the recommended limits at baseline were excluded. The adjusted pooled odds ratio for new onset risky alcohol use was 1.12 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.20) for those working long hours (≥55 in the individual participant data studies), compared with those working standard hours (35-40) (fig 5
⇓
). The associations were similar in the individual participant data (1.12, 1.01 to 1.25) and two studies with published aggregate data (1.10, 0.66 to 1.84). The I
2
statistic for heterogeneity was 0% (P=0.96) overall; 0% (P=0.99) in the individual participant data studies and 56% (P=0.10) in the aggregate data.

We further examined whether the prospective associations were similar in men and women, in older (≥50) and younger (<50) employees, among socioeconomic groups, in different geographical areas, in different study samples, and different levels of risky drinking (<9.0%
v
≥9.0%) in the cohort (fig 6
⇓
). The analyses of sex, age, and socioeconomic group were carried out in the individual participant data studies; for geographical region and type of study sample, all prospective studies were included and for the level of drinking, one study with aggregate data
28
provided data. Although the odds ratio among women seemed greater (1.36, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 1.68) than among men (1.11, 0.98 to 1.25), the difference was not significant (P=0.09). The associations were not dependent on age or socioeconomic group, region, sample type, or the level of risky drinking in the cohort (all P>0.09 for heterogeneity). To examine whether the association was dependent on sample attrition, we performed the analyses in subgroups with follow-up participation rate of <75%
v
≥75%. The corresponding odds ratio in the former group was 1.18 (1.02 to 1.36) and 1.10 (1.01 to 1.20) in the latter, with P=0.44 for heterogeneity (data not shown).

In the individual participant data studies, we examined the association between each working hours category (<35, 41-48, 49-54, and ≥55) in comparison with 35-40 hours a week associated with risky alcohol use. In the prospective analysis that excluded those who were risky users at baseline (fig 7
⇓
), the overall incidence of risky alcohol use was 6.3% and the incidence among those working 35-40 hours was 6.2%. A part time job (<35 hours) and working 41-48 hours were not associated with new onset risky alcohol use whereas working 49-54 hours was associated with an odds ratio of 1.13 (95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.26; adjusted difference in incidence 0.8 percentage points) and working 55 hours or more was associated with an odds ratio of 1.12 (1.01 to 1.25; adjusted difference in incidence 0.7 percentage points).

In the corresponding cross sectional analysis the adjusted odds ratio of risky alcohol use was 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.88 to 1.02) for <35 hours, 1.03 (0.97 to 1.09) for 41-48 hours, 1.13 (1.05 to 1.22) for 49-54 hours, and 1.10 (1.04 to 1.18) for ≥55 hours when compared with standard 35-40 weekly working hours (data not shown). The adjusted difference in prevalence was 1.5 percentage points among those with 49-54 weekly working hours and 1.1 percentage points among those with 55 hours or more, when compared with the prevalence among employees working 35-40 hours (11.3%).
Finally, we used the individual participant data studies to examine whether long working hours were associated with sustained risky alcohol use among those who were risky users at baseline (data not shown). The odds ratio for sustained risky alcohol use among risky users who worked ≥55 hours at baseline was 1.16 (95% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.61) compared with those working standard 35-40 hours a week, suggesting a similar though non-significant association to that found for new onset risky use among non-risky users at baseline.
Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis of 63 studies provides comprehensive evidence of an association between long working hours and alcohol use. Long working hours were associated with 1.11-fold likelihood of higher levels of alcohol use in the cross sectional analysis of 333 693 participants from 14 countries. A similar association (odds ratio 1.12) for new onset risky alcohol use was observed in a prospective analysis of 20 studies including 100 602 participants from nine countries. The associations were not dependent on participants’ sex, age, socioeconomic status, geographical region, type of study sample, prevalence of risky alcohol use in the cohort, or participation rate at follow-up. Eighteen prospective studies with individual participant data allowed us to perform a more refined comparison between work hour categories. Compared with the standard (35-40) weekly working hours, working 49-54 hours was associated with an odds ratio of 1.13 and working ≥55 hours a week was associated with an odds ratio of 1.12 for new onset risky alcohol use.
Strengths and limitations
Our systematic review and meta-analysis provides the first quantitative summary estimate of the association between long working hours and alcohol use. This has not been provided in previous narrative reviews.
11
13
18
We found only two published studies with a prospective design. Our meta-analysis, however, included 18 prospective cohort studies with unpublished individual participant data, which allowed us to examine the prospective association between long working hours and the onset of risky alcohol use in a large dataset with a harmonised exposure and outcome measurements.
Comparison of published studies with aggregate data and studies with unpublished individual participant data allowed us to account for publication bias, which can bias results from meta-analyses that use only published studies.
19
We observed no evidence for publication bias. Firstly, we found similar associations among both types of study. Secondly, statistical assessment of publication bias among published studies, stratified by whether long working hours and alcohol use was the main or secondary research question, and use of a funnel plot and Egger’s test of a small study effect suggested no indication of publication bias.
The present meta-analysis has limitations. With the exception of three published studies that used roster or payroll data,
39
50
53
exposure to long working hours was based on self reports and measured only once. Prolonged exposure to long working hours, as identified in repeat data, might carry a greater risk of risky alcohol use than long working hours measured only once. Self reported working hours might involve recall bias arising from the inability of the employees to accurately recall hours worked. Some investigators, however, have shown that self reported work hours is a reliable measure (for example, two week test-retest intraclass correlation coefficient
r
=0.91),
85
86
and a major bias in longitudinal analysis is likely only if the error in estimating the number of hours worked varies according to alcohol use.
Alcohol use was based on self reported frequency or amount of alcohol used, except in one cross sectional study that used the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) to assess DSM-IV diagnoses of alcohol use disorders.
58
Under-reporting of alcohol use has been shown to occur in survey questionnaires
87
and might be particularly common in heavy drinkers. A major bias would occur if under-reporting was also associated with reporting of working hours. Misclassification of alcohol use could have introduced heterogeneity into the meta-analyses.
Furthermore, this meta-analysis was based on observational studies, which are generalisable only within the study context. Despite cultural variations in drinking habits, even between developed countries,
1
our findings regarding long working hours and alcohol use were similar across the different geographical regions examined. Our results are also in accordance with global reports of alcohol use, which have shown large differences in alcohol consumption between countries.
1
We found, for example, that the prevalence of risky alcohol use was lower in the US than in Europe. Although the prevalence of risky alcohol use varied substantially among the cohorts, we found no evidence to suggest that the association between long working hours and alcohol use would be dependent on the prevalence of risky alcohol use in the cohort.
Even though our IPD-Work collaboration includes several major cohort studies in Europe and the two open access databases are large, including cohorts from the US, UK, and Australia, the meta-analysis of individual participant data is based on a convenience sample and does not include all potential data. Thus, availability bias might have affected the findings.
19
Finally, it is not possible to draw causal inference based on observational studies, which means that our data cannot provide direct evidence for policy recommendations.
88
Prospective analyses, however, allowed us to get some indication of temporal order of associations, which is consistent with a causal effect, and partially overcomes the problem of reverse causality (risky alcohol use leading to longer working hours), which can bias cross sectional analyses.
Comparison with previous research and sources of heterogeneity
Previous narrative reviews of long working hours and alcohol use including up to six studies have reported mixed findings.
11
13
18
Similarly, we observed substantial heterogeneity among published studies with aggregate data (I
2
=81%, P<0.001). Importantly, this heterogeneity was not present in the meta-analysis of individual participant data studies with harmonised exposure and outcome measures (I
2
=18%, P=0.21 in the cross-sectional analysis; 0%, P=0.99 in the prospective analysis). None of the potential sources of heterogeneity examined in this study explained the heterogeneity found among the cross sectional studies with aggregate data. We explored whether use of a definition of the exposure and outcome close to that used in the individual participant data studies would remove the heterogeneity observed in the six published studies but found no such reduction (I
2
=68.6%, P=0.007). It seems that the sources of heterogeneity must relate to other differences between published studies with aggregate data.
Interpretation of findings
In this meta-analysis, working very long hours (≥55 a week) was associated with a 1.12-fold increase in the odds ratio of new onset risky alcohol use among employees whose alcohol use was within the recommended limits at baseline. A similar (1.13-fold) association was found among those who worked 49-54 hours a week. To protect employee health and safety, the European Union Working Time Directive requires EU countries to guarantee all workers the right to work a maximum of 48 hours a week, on average, including overtime.
23
This threshold is supported by our analyses. At risk alcohol use has previously been associated with increased risk of liver cirrhosis, cancers, seizure disorders, and stroke.
2
A recent meta-analysis of 56 epidemiological studies using Mendelian randomisation analysis suggested that reduction of alcohol consumption, even for light to moderate drinkers, might be beneficial for cardiovascular health.
89
Possible explanations for the association between long working hours and risky alcohol use might involve the work environment as well as individual characteristics.
90
One view is that alcohol use alleviates stress that is caused by work pressure and working conditions. Working overtime and characteristics such as high demands and lack of control might contribute to stress at work.
91
92
Although our recent individual participant data meta-analysis found little evidence to support a combination of high demands and low job control as a predictor of risky alcohol use,
9
it remains to be investigated whether a combination of long working hours and low control over work increases the risk. It has also been hypothesised that employees who are not well integrated and supervised by the work organisation are at a higher risk of developing alcohol use problems.
90
Depression and sleep problems might contribute to the link between long working hours and alcohol use.
16
Other factors, such as personality traits, could confound the association because they might make people work long hours and also be related to a tendency to risky alcohol use. For example, individuals with “type A” behaviour pattern,
93
which is characterised by aggressiveness and irritability and a chronic struggle to achieve more and more in less and less time,
94
can end up in highly competitive jobs and work communities characterised by a “work hard play hard” culture with positive attitudes towards heavy alcohol use.
95
96
Personality traits of impulsivity and novelty seeking have also been found to be associated with risky alcohol use.
97
Although the legislation in European countries provides employees with the right to restrict maximum working hours to 48 hours a week, many people still work long hours either as their own choice or because of external pressure to do so.
98
Choosing to work long hours is common among the higher socioeconomic groups, with highly educated managers and professionals expecting dedication to work from themselves and others. This strategy can be highly rewarding in terms of rapid promotions, salary increases, and control over work. On the other hand, involuntary long hours could reflect, for example, financial difficulties and striving for a living wage or coercion. We did not find differences in the association between long working hours and risky alcohol use between socioeconomic groups. It is possible that voluntary and involuntary overtime is more evenly distributed across socioeconomic groups than previously thought.
Conclusions and unanswered questions
The workplace is an important setting for the prevention of alcohol misuse because more than half of the adult population are employed.
4
Risky alcohol use is an issue in the workplace because it can have adverse and serious effects on employees, such as absenteeism,
80
inefficiency, poor performance, impaired decision making, damaged customer relations, and injuries at work.

8
Brief interventions by healthcare personnel that involve assessment of the individual’s drinking habits in combination with feedback about health risks might be useful in efforts to reduce problems with alcohol use in the working population.
4
Our findings suggest that alcohol consumption is more likely to rise to risky levels among employees who work more than 48 hours a week compared with those with standard working hours. In absolute terms, however, the difference between these groups was relatively small because the adjusted incidence in new onset risky alcohol use was only 0.8 and 0.7 percentage points higher among individuals who worked 49-54 and 55 hours or more compared with those who worked standard hours. Further research is needed to assess whether preventive interventions against risky alcohol use could benefit from information on working hours.
What is already known on this topic
The European Union Working Time Directive threshold for long working hours is 48 hours a week
Long working hours are thought to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, sleep deprivation, occupational injuries, and mental health problems
The association between long working hours and risky alcohol use has not been systematically evaluated
What this study adds
This meta-analysis of 36 published studies, identified by systematic literature searches, and 27 studies with unpublished individual participant data synthesised evidence on the association between long working hours and alcohol use
Long working hours were linked to increased alcohol use in cross sectional and prospective analyses. People working more than 48 hours a week at baseline had 1.13 times higher likelihood of new onset risky alcohol use compared with those working standard hours
No heterogeneity was observed between men and women or by age group, socioeconomic status, geographical region, or characteristics of the study cohort

Summary
View help for Summary
Similar to the 2006 study, ""Ithaka 2006 Survey of US Higher Education Faculty Attitudes and Behaviors"" (ICPSR 22700), this survey examined faculty attitudes and behaviors on key issues ranging from the library as an information gateway and the need for preservation of scholarly material, to faculty engagement with institutional disciplinary repositories and thoughts about open access.
Respondents were asked to identify the primary resource they used for locating information for their research, provide their opinion on the transition of hardcopy library collections to electronic versions, as well as accessing or disseminating scholarly content, and gauge their dependence on college or university libraries in conducting research.
In addition, respondents were asked how important various library resources and library and scholarly societies were to their research or teaching, and how important they expect library resources will be in five years.
Respondents were queried about their use of electronic search engines, and how often certain methods were used to find information in academic journals.
In addition, the survey gathered respondent information on whether they deposited various types of electronic materials or used content deposited by others, the type of repository to which they deposited content, and the importance of long-term electronic data preservation.
Lastly, respondents were asked whether they owned an electronic reading device, whether audio or video recordings of their courses were available online, and to rate the importance certain characteristics of academic journals had on influencing their decision of whether or not to publish an article in that journal.
Demographic and other background information includes age, gender, job title, primary academic field, number of years in current position and field, and view of self as a researcher or teacher.

Summary
View help for Summary
The Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods
(PHDCN) was a large-scale, interdisciplinary study of how families,
schools, and neighborhoods affect child and adolescent
development. One component of the PHDCN was the Longitudinal Cohort
Study, which was a series of coordinated longitudinal studies that
followed over 6,000 randomly selected children, adolescents, and young
adults, and their primary caregivers over time to examine the changing
circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics,
that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial
behaviors. Numerous measures were administered to respondents to
gauge various aspects of human development, including individual
differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences. One such
measure was the Personal Identity instrument. It was administered to
subjects in Cohorts 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 and obtained information
related to racial and ethnic identity, which was originally collected
in PROJECT ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN):
DEMOGRAPHIC FILE, WAVE 1, 1994-1997 (ICPSR 13581), and PROJECT ON
HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN): DEMOGRAPHIC FILE,
WAVE 2, 1997-2000 (ICPSR 13609). It also contained future orientation
and discrimination questions, as well as questions relating to group
importance that were drawn from the Puerto Rican Adolescent Survey.

Study Purpose
View help for Study Purpose
Project on Human Development in Chicago
Neighborhoods
The Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN)
was a large-scale, interdisciplinary study of how families, schools,
and neighborhoods affect child and adolescent development. It was
designed to advance the understanding of the developmental pathways of
both positive and negative human social behaviors. In particular, the
project examined the causes and pathways of juvenile delinquency,
adult crime, substance abuse, and violence. At the same time, the
project provided a detailed look at the environments in which these
social behaviors took place by collecting substantial amounts of data
about urban Chicago, including its people, institutions, and
resources.
Longitudinal Cohort Study
One component of the PHDCN was the Longitudinal Cohort Study, which
was a series of coordinated longitudinal studies that followed over
6,000 randomly selected children, adolescents, and young adults, and
their primary caregivers over time to examine the changing
circumstances of their lives, as well as the personal characteristics,
that might lead them toward or away from a variety of antisocial
behaviors. The age cohorts include birth (0), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18
years. Numerous measures were administered to respondents to gauge
various aspects of human development, including individual
differences, as well as family, peer, and school influences.
Personal Identity
The data in this collection are from Wave 3 of the Longitudinal
Cohort Study, which was administered between 2000 and 2002. The data
files contain information from the Personal Identity protocol. The
Personal Identity instrument obtained information related to racial
and ethnic identity, group importance, future orientation, and
discrimination.
Study Design
View help for Study Design
Project on Human Development in Chicago
Neighborhoods
The city of Chicago was selected as the research site for the PHDCN
because of its extensive racial, ethnic, and social-class diversity.
The project collapsed 847 census tracts in the city of Chicago into
343 neighborhood clusters (NCs) based upon seven groupings of
racial/ethnic composition and three levels of socioeconomic status.
The NCs were designed to be ecologically meaningful. They were
composed of geographically contiguous census tracts, and geographic
boundaries, and knowledge of Chicago's neighborhoods were considered
in the definition of the NCs. Each NC was comprised of approximately
8,000 people.
Longitudinal Cohort Study
For the Longitudinal Cohort Study, a stratified probability sample
of 80 neighborhoods was selected. The 80 NCs were sampled from the 21
strata (seven racial/ethnic groups by three socioeconomic levels) with
the goal of representing the 21 cells as equally as possible to
eliminate the confounding between racial/ethnic mix and socioeconomic
status. Once the 80 NCs were chosen, then block groups were selected
at random within each of the sample neighborhoods. A complete listing
of dwelling units was collected for all sampled block groups.
Pregnant women, children, and young adults in seven age cohorts
(birth, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years) were identified through
in-person screening of approximately 40,000 dwelling units within the
80 NCs. The screening response rate was 80 percent. Children within
six months of the birthday that qualified them for the sample were
selected for inclusion in the Longitudinal Cohort Study. A total of
8,347 participants were identified through the screening. Of the
eligible study participants, 6,228 were interviewed in the Wave 1 data
collection, 5,338 were interviewed in the Wave 2 data collection, and
4,850 were interviewed in the Wave 3 data collection.
Data collection for Wave 3 began in 2000 and ended in 2002. It
included a letter sent to study participants notifying them that they
would be contacted to schedule an interview. Additional information on
the contact log included the dates and research assistant ID of the
Wave 2 interview (or the status of the case if incomplete in Wave 2),
a list of household composition and ID numbers of other household
members in the study, the name the telephone was listed under, the
recontact information from Waves 1 and 2, and an updated history of
addresses.
For all cohorts except 0 and 18, primary caregivers as well as the
child were interviewed. The primary caregiver was the person found to
spend the most time taking care of the child. Separate research
assistants administered the primary caregiver interviews and the child
interviews. The primary method of data collection was face-to-face
interviewing, although participants who refused to complete the
personal interview were administered a phone interview. An abbreviated
telephone interview was conducted for the primary caregivers in
Cohorts 0-15 and Cohort 18 study participants in Wave 3 who lived
outside the nine-county metropolitan area to which research assistants
were able to travel for interviews. In Wave 3, phone interviews were
also conducted with the study participants in Cohort 15. People who
refused to complete the two-hour in-person interview were administered
the phone interview. A total of 391 telephone interviews were
conducted during Wave 3, representing 6.3 percent of the sample.
Proxy interviews were conducted with study participants who were
emancipated minors (under 18 but married or living independently). The
study participants answered questions from the primary caregiver's
interview on the primary caregiver's behalf. In Wave 3, one primary
caregiver and eleven study participants (young adults) were
interviewed in jail. They were located in either the Cook County Jail
or in one of the state prisons. Those study participants in a state
system outside the nine-county area were also interviewed by phone.
Study participants in foster care could not be interviewed. The
Department of Children and Family Services did not allow interviews of
the foster parent or the child. Permission was granted for a brief
period in Wave 1, therefore there are some children in the sample who
could not be followed up in Waves 2 and 3. Some children were not in
foster care in Wave 1 but were placed in foster care by Wave 2 or
3. They were also not followed up. Lastly, some participants were
interviewed in Wave 3 but not in Wave 2, as they were in foster care
during Wave 2.
Some participants in Wave 1 spoke a language other than English,
Spanish, or Polish. In Wave 3, an abbreviated version of the primary
caregiver's protocol was administered, and the research assistant
arranged for someone in the household to translate on the spot. In
Wave 3, the complete protocol was translated into Spanish.
Depending on the age and wave of data collection, participants were
paid between $5 and $20 per interview. Other incentives, such as free
passes to museums, the aquarium, and monthly drawing prizes, were also
included.
Interview protocols included a wide range of questions. For
example, some questions assessed impulse control and sensation-seeking
traits, cognitive and language development, leisure activities,
delinquency and substance abuse, friends' activities, and
self-perception, attitudes, and values. Caregivers were also
interviewed about family structure, parent characteristics,
parent-child relationships, parent discipline styles, family mental
health, and family history of criminal behavior and drug use.
For primary caregivers included in Wave 3 but not in Wave 2, an
addendum interview was administered consisting of measures or portions
of measures from the Wave 2 interview. An addendum was also given to
the Cohort 15 and 18 study participants who were not included in Wave
2. A total of 164 primary caregivers and 62 young adult (Cohorts 15
and 18) addendums were completed in Wave 3.
Personal Identity
The Personal Identity instrument was administered to subjects in
Cohorts 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 and obtained information related to
racial and ethnic identity, which was originally collected in PROJECT
ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN): DEMOGRAPHIC
FILE, WAVE 1, 1994-1997 (ICPSR 13581), and PROJECT ON HUMAN
DEVELOPMENT IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS (PHDCN): DEMOGRAPHIC FILE, WAVE
2, 1997-2000 (ICPSR 13609). It also contained future orientation and
discrimination questions, as well as questions relating to group
importance that were drawn from the Puerto Rican Adolescent Survey.

Description of Variables
View help for Description of Variables
The data files contain information related to
racial or ethnic identity. Respondents were asked if they were a
member of one or more than one racial or ethnic group and to identify
to which group(s) they felt they belonged. Subjects were asked if they
attended religious services and how important religious beliefs were
to them. There was also a series of questions related to the most
important ethnic or religious group of which the respondent was a
member. For these questions, respondents were asked how much they
agreed with statements such as, ""I have tried to learn about (group)
history, traditions, and customs,"" or ""I feel like I am a member of
the (group) community."" Respondents were also asked about employment
expectations. For Cohorts 6, 9, and 12, respondents were asked about
the kind of job they would like to have when they became an adult, and
respondents in Cohorts 15 and 18 were asked about employment five
years from the interview. Respondents were also asked how much they
agreed with statements such as, ""I will be able to support myself
(when I am an adult/five years from now),"" or ""Most people in my
neighborhood will be better off than me."" As before, respondents in
Cohorts 6, 9, and 12 were read statements in terms of when they were
an adult, and respondents in Cohorts 15 and 18 were read statements in
terms of five years from the interview. Respondents were also asked
questions regarding discrimination including where they felt they had
been discriminated against, why they felt they had been discriminated
against, and where they worried about being discriminated against.
Respondents in Cohorts 15 and 18 were asked an additional set of
questions about how well they could do certain things such as
controlling their temper, keeping their spirits up when they suffered
a hardship, or stopping themselves from being upset about everyday
problems.

Summary
View help for Summary
These data are part of NACJD's Fast Track Release and are distributed as they were received from the data depositor. The files have been zipped by NACJD for release, but not checked or processed except for the removal of direct identifiers. Users should refer to the accompanying readme file for a brief description of the files available with this collection and consult the investigator(s) if further information is needed.
This study was designed to understand the economic and social structure of the market for stolen data on-line. This data provides information on the costs of various forms of personal information and cybercrime services, the payment systems used, social organization and structure of the market, and interactions between buyers, sellers, and forum operators. The PIs used this data to assess the economy of stolen data markets, the social organization of participants, and the payment methods and services used.
The study utilized a sample of approximately 1,900 threads generated from 13 web forums, 10 of which used Russian as their primary language and three which used English. These forums were hosted around the world, and acted as online advertising spaces for individuals to sell and buy a range of products. The content of these forums were downloaded and translated from Russian to English to create a purposive, yet convenient sample of threads from each forum.
The collection contains 1 SPSS data file (ICPSR Submission Economic File SPSS.sav) with 39 variables and 13,735 cases and 1 Access data file (Social Network Analysis File Revised 04-11-14.mdb) with a total of 16 data tables and 199 variables.
Qualitative data used to examine the associations and working relationships present between participants at the micro and macro-level are not available at this time.

It was unclear from the documentation provided by the PI as to how many threads were used in the analysis.  Three different numbers were provided (1,889 ; 1,893 ; and 1,899).  Because of this issue, ICPSR uses the term ""approximately 1,900"" when referencing the number of threads.

Methodology
Study Purpose
View help for Study Purpose
The purpose of this study was to assess the economy and market processes of the market for stolen data operating on-line, as well as its organization and network structure.
Study Design
View help for Study Design
This study utilized a sample of approximately 1,900 threads from 13 web forums where criminals and hackers buy, sell, and trade stolen financial and personal information. Eight of the sites sampled were publicly accessible, in that the entire site could be accessed by anyone in the general public. The five remaining sites required that an individual create a registered user account within the site in order to access the content of the sub-forums related to data sales. In order to capture the forum content across all sites, the researchers created usernames for each forum but did not  interact with other registered participants to reduce the potential for contamination.
Researchers utilized both qualitative and quantitative methods to address the research questions of this study. Specifically, quantitative analysis techniques were used to examine the economy of the market, while qualitative grounded theory analyses were used to explore the social organization of the market. Finally, quantitative social network analyses were used to assess the relationships between participants in these markets.
For the Economic Data Coding (ICPSR Submission Economic File SPSS.sav), content analysis techniques were applied to classify the various products, resources, and materials sold or sought out in these forums. The content of each ad was coded based on the detail provided. Each item was coded individually, such that an advertisement where an individual was selling credit card numbers as well as PayPal accounts were coded as a single instance of each activity. In addition, any additional advertisements or updates in a thread were coded as new cases to capture variations in pricing and products over time.
The Social Network Analysis (Social Network Analysis File Revised 04-11-14.mdb) allowed researchers to visualize and quantify the information on large networks and complex relationships. Network
analysis allowed both the visualization of users' communications, as well as the extraction of network connectivity. The exchanges between individuals in these forums allowed for the identification of network structures within and across all the forums. This type of analysis allowed for the identification of global patterns in the otherwise hidden networks of data market participants, and connectivity between participants. In addition, social network analysis enabled researchers to consider connections between participants based on their role in both the forum and in the course of any sales or exchanges noted in a thread.
Applying social network analysis techniques to forum data, individual posters became network vertices, while their forum interactions established connections between them. The username for each poster, regardless of what forum it appeared in, served as a basis to assess connections between individuals, and consider the flow of information from one agent, or vertex, to another. This allowed researchers to build a set of arcs, or connections between hackers.
Sample
View help for Sample
A convenience sample of approximately 1,900 threads from 13 public and private forums engaged in sale of stolen data in both Russian and English were collected. The sample of forums was developed via a snowball sampling procedure similar to those used in traditional qualitative field work in the real world. Such a tactic was valuable as there was no immediate way to document the total number of stolen data markets operating around the world at any point in time. Thus, this sample began with the identification of three English language forums through Google.com using common terms in stolen data markets, including ""carding dump purchase sale cvv."" One of these sites was a sub-forum of a larger Russian language forum. After exploring the content of threads from these sites, three Russian language forums were identified via web links provided by forum users. Six additional forums were identified using the same processes to create a total of 10 Russian language sites and three English language forums.

Description of Variables
View help for Description of Variables
The Economic Data File (ICPSR Submission Economic File SPSS.sav ; 39 variables, n=13,735) includes information related to the forum such as language used and hosting location, as well as information related to the poster including whether they list e-mail.  For items being sold, there are variables pertaining to what is being sold and at what price, whether there is a minimum purchase, and whether there is a bulk discount.  There is also information detailing which nations are being harmed and what payment type the poster seeks.  There are also variables regarding whether the poster provides customer service, whether the poster provides samples, whether the poster provides free replacements, and whether the forum is a ripping forum.
The tables in the Social Network Analysis data file (Social Network Analysis File Revised 04-11-14.mdb ; 16 tables, 199 variables) include the name of the forum, a username, the level or role or the user in the forum, the date the user joined that particular forum as a member, and the date the user started the thread or posted in the thread.  There are also variables regarding the number of posts the user has had, any funding the user has, what the post is about, and whether the post pertains to buying or selling.  There is also information related to the user who started the thread, a list of the usernames within the thread in sequential order, a thread number, and a list of the usernames to which the post is being directed.
